"Hey guys what's up? I have a question for you... I'm getting a lot of messages from ""art traders"" profiles telling that my NFT ART is amazing and saying that they'll be able to sell it for at leats 1eth if I buy one of their advertisement packages and working strategies for someting like 50$. So my question is... If you think that my art is ""amazing"" and worth of 1Eth wouldn't be better if you bought it for, let's say, 0.03Eth and resell it for 1Eth? Or do you really rather profit only 50$? What's the logic behind that? I'm having a tough time trying to understand. The whole purpose of tokenizing something like ""art"" is the trading possibilities, isn't it?",0.8986,0.03,0.854,0.115

"Since I'm hearing that NFT's can be anything, do you think it would be profitable to pair them with an AirBnB?  For example, a friend has an AirBnB on the beach and I know spring break has to be the most sought after week for his guests.  What if he sold *the right to buy* that week as an NFT?  He could make a nice looking digital resort ticket with some other goodies inside, etc...

"Ok here me out…  I’m newer to the NFT space but love the idea of NFT projects having roadmaps that involve gaming as well. I thought it would be really cool to have a Star Wars or space type of game.  I thought first you start with an NFT  where people can only mint one per wallet and it’s nothing but planets. These would eventually be the areas of the game you could travel to. If you own the NFT you could create a guild or something, and members would receive some bonus/benefit when they were “stationed” on planet.  The next NFT could be something like spaceships that would allow for travel throughout the game’s universe.  The next NFT would be playable characters.  The next NFT could be additional weapons, etc.  What do you guys think? Obviously just a rough idea with some areas that need to be filled out.",0.8988,0.053,0.817,0.13

"I was working with a friend on a bunch of NFTs that were aimed to raise money for #TeamTrees by donating 25% of every 'sale' from the collection. We agreed I would make the artwork and he would make the promos, website, socials and handle the actual technical side of the NFTs (to which my knowledge is very limited). The idea I came up with was to have a collection of 365 leaf NFT characters that go through all the seasonal colours creating a unique spectrum of cute leaf designs. I've now made 100's of them and my friend has told me to go on without him as he has had other commitments and he wouldn't be able to spend the required time to push the images.   Now I'm left in the position of what the fuck to do?? I'm clueless with NFTs, I'm not savvy with how they work or how to promote them and I am left with 100's of finished products. Should I forget the whole thing and write it off as a waste of time or is there someone out there with another idea?  I've attached an image of one of the FEB &amp; JAN additions, the thing that I'm proud of is when you line up all of the images from JAN 1st to DEC 31st it makes a constant animated loop. I'll try and attach an example of the first 2 months to what I mean.  It would be a shame to see them waste away in my files but sometimes that life!  Also: I've not posted on Reddit before so I'm hoping the images get attached and I hope this post is allowed.  Fingers crossed.

"NFT wizards, I seek your assistance.  Platforms like OpenSea allow you to mint your NFT (publish your NFT) on their platform using either ETH or Polygon. I see that the obvious benefit of using Polygon over ETH is about not paying the gas fee. However, what is the downside?  If I mint using Polygon, can I not sell in ETH? I believe I read that if you mint using Polygon, you cannot auction stuff like when minted using ETH (because Polygon does not have that option of auction yet) but I saw some video recently that showed you can actually do everything on the NFT while minting through Polygon, that you can by doing the same with ETH?

Who would have imagined that using #️⃣hashtags would make your real money one day?  Utilizing blockchain technology to build a store of value fungible cryptographic asset named as TAG coin which has a limited and defined supply that can be mined by staking another non-fungible cryptographic asset called #️⃣hashtags which can be registered and acquired as a nft token. TAG coin mining yield on the #️⃣hashtag nft miner is derived from measuring#️⃣hashtag’s performance on various social media platforms using a transparent #️⃣hashtag performance grading system.  NFT's have become the most popular form of digital investment in the current crypto bull run. It is a plight to discover a genuine performance-based project in times when people are selling anything from Ape to Artwork and there are buyers available around the globe.  A project in which you can purchase hashtags as NFT. eg. #usa #football #love. These hashtags are evaluated by their performance on Twitter through Google Analytics. The project creators are also working for social media integration simultaneously (they never stop building).  **The #️⃣hashtag you purchase provides you with TAG Coins every day. It’s like an auto-mining machine.**,0.8997,0.01,0.912,0.078

"**TLDR:**    I create digital art pieces that 'evolve organically' based on rules (eg changes color based on the weather in New York). I would like to sell them as NFTs. Is this possible?   **Details:**   I have a background in digital multimedia and software engineering.  A long time ago I used to enjoy scripting digital art that evolved 'organically', based on time of day, the weather, etc. This was a \*very\* long time ago, and I did this all in Flash (R.I.P.), when Flash was still a thing, owned by Macromedia (pre-Adobe). I exported from flash to SWF files and embedded them on websites.  I don't know much about NFTs, but people seemed to dig the organic digital art back then, and i imagine there may be a place for such in the world of NFTs. Imagine an NFT that evolves based on the weather, your mood, or how well your favorite sports team is doing. However, the only NFTs i have seen are 'fixed', in that they are static, and don't evolve over time.    How would i go about distributing an NFT that has code attached to it, that is 'living' and 'evolving' based on external input ( eg: from a weather API )?  What file format? What platform?

This key will be sold for a very high price, as the treasure is worth that much or even more if it ends up in the right hands.

"Let's say I draw Naruto NFTs and actually sell them on Opensea. Am I in trouble and will get sued, because of copyright and all those things?  So I would draw them by hand, actually looking at image found on the internet. Not copying already existing NFT, but copying random image from the web. The image wouldn't be an exact copy, because my drawing is crap, so most of them would be drawn in kind of a fun manner. Image done strict with a pen, no added colours, nothing like that. The characters would also have different names, but really similar to original ones.   To sum up: The drawings will be made on a piece of paper by hand, using only pen, while looking at existing images on the web. Won't be a proper redraw, because I am not an artist , but you will definitely see similarities. Please let me know if this would cause legal issues.",0.906,0.063,0.808,0.129

Kinda like when a movie gains success and its followed by a sh#tty sequel.  I didn’t even like the BAYC project in the first place let alone this cheesy cash grab of coin.  Its very overinflated and most people arent even willing to buy at this high of a price. The owners were artificially inflating prices and some were caught doing so.  If anything there many other NFT projects like Last Hopium that offer the same exclusivity but at a much cheaper price.  So I don’t get what all the hype is about.

This means its not decentraliced and its just a cut which opensea gives you.  I was under the impressions that royalties are created in the smart contract when the token initially is created by the original creator.   I always thought that it means that if an NFT with royalties in the contract itself will be transfered, then the original creater will get a cut, no matter where you sell/transfer it, am I wrong here?

""How is this a NFT - non-fungible token (i.e. 1 unique token) - if the exact same thing is on Ethereum network and you want to also put it on the Cardano network? You would have two identical copies of the same image (unless the Cardano network one is different somehow). Isn't that just the same as 'copy and paste'. Wouldn't the buyer on Ethereum feel duped if he thought he a one of a kind, only to see that someone has the 'exact' same thing but on another blockchain?   To me, personally - this is like a painter - painting the exact same - completely identically (so no one can spot any differences) - on two canvases. Sure the canvases might be different thicknesses - but the artwork is what any collector is paying for not the canvas. The painter cannot say he has painted 1 unique (non fungible) painting if it is on two different canvas thicknesses.   Maybe it's just me - but if you want to have a collection across different blockchains (something I am working on), then there needs to be some clear differences between NFT artwork.""",0.9103,0.029,0.885,0.086

The first thing to check is the date of creation of the  account of the staffs   The second thing to look at is the mint price if it is too high generally it is not a good sign if the stock is very low the mint can be a little higher but projects with a big stock and a very high mint price are generally not very legit.   The third thing to check is the activity if the server was opened only about 2/3 days ago and there are already more than 100k people in the server most of the time it's only bots, you can also look at the number of people who are online if out of 100k people only 10k are constantly online it's not normal.   The fourth thing to check is the messages in the server if all the messages in the chat are the same it's usually just bots writing.   Another thing to check is how easy it is to get the WL in general if in a project it is very easy to get the WL despite a large number of people in the server it usually means that the founders just want to make sure they have enough WL people who will buy.   Another point to check is the time the founders spend in the project if the mint date is very close to the creation date of the project this is usually not a good sign, the founders of a serious project have time they don't rush.   Another point to check is the rate of engagement on their social networks and check the percentage of fake accounts.   My last advice would be to choose projects where the activity is not overly realistic but not too low either, generally the good projects have a normal activity on their social networks.  Thank you for reading this far I wish you a good day and success in the world of NFTs.",0.9106,0.062,0.846,0.092

You may have heard the term NFT or Non-fungible token. We can infer the roots of these words non meaning not and fungible being duplicated. What an NFT is it’s a piece of art with a serial code connected and I don’t mean the frosted flakes kind. Every NFT has a unique code to verify it's yours. This means that no-one can have the same NFT as you and it's completely original. Some people think that by saving the image they will “own the NFT” but they only contain the image and not the code that comes with it. What this allows is what makes it so special. An analogy is the “Self Portrait” piece by Van Gogh is a piece of art but could theoretically be forged. The NFT “Everydays” however can never be replicated because it is easy to verify that it is the right piece of art. Both of these sold for around 70 million but are very different from one being from the late 1800’s and one from last year.,0.9115,0.0,0.929,0.071

"Italy, the homeland of art, Shiba, the coin of the future... what can the art of the future be? A mix of them: Italian Shibas!  The backgrounds are the most iconic monuments and icons of Italy: from the immortal Colosseum in Rome to the beautiful and iconic Rialto Bridge in Venice, from the magnificent Sicilian mosaics to the Sardinian flag, and how can we forget the legendary Piaggio Vespa? Every Shiba is placed in front of a truly Italian symbol.  Jumping Shiba, serious Shiba, optimistic Shiba... you are spoiled for choice, we have 9 different Shibas! Each one has a hat (from the tricolor one to the graduation hat), glasses (watch for the ones with double glasses!) and mouths... but only a few of them have ""the extras"": a slice of pizza, a good glass of wine, a typical pasta or a refreshing ice cream, will you find the *italianest* of the Shibas?",0.913,0.017,0.884,0.099

I met her few months ago and she draws amazing art - has a background in art and I mentioned that I can bring my tech background and we can form a 50-50 partnership. She was open to it and wants me to draw up a contract. My first question is - where do I even go to get such a contract made and more importantly - since crypto gains fluctuate on a constant basis - what is the right time to split the profits with her? I am not saying we are gonna make any money at all- But ""if"" we do.. I just don't wanna get sued nor do I wanna write up a dumb contract where she can sue me in the future.

"I'm an artist. Basically in the title, modular artwork that gets randomly generated to produce different combinations of rarity in order to be traded on an internal marketplace. Pretty straightforward.  What I want to know is about payment structure. Given that BoredApes can sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of ETH for rare images, I would be fucking stupid to take a job where I get paid only on a per image basis or an hourly rate to make the artwork. If this has even the slightest success given the potential of the business model, then the cost of producing the images can be way under the revenue potential from them.  I don't want to get exploited, but I also know fuck all about NFT's. How do I ask for a revenue sharing deal from the sale of the NFT that goes onto the marketplace? We've discussed making separate NFT's of the artwork itself, but since the NFT provides keys, access and membership to the marketplace, I don't see the separate artwork having much intrinsic value compared to the products made from them, which is why I think I need to ask about revenue sharing on the artwork I make.

Stephen Colbert being the latest, others being Adidas, Prada, Dolce &amp; Gabbana. Hell even the NFL. As much as I love Ethereum I think the switch to Polygon or other scaling solutions is happening as we speak. Look at Polygon's numbers on Opensea and compare them to how they were just a few months ago. I won't even post them, go and DYOR. Find out for yourself.  How do you feel about NFT finally beginning to move away from Ethereum? I know some people will remain stubborn but for the rest of us.

"Does someone know other projects similar to Crypto Plant Club?   We are a club for the plant and gardening community in the NFT space. If you love real plants, virtual plants, or both you will find a like-minded tribe here.     Pots + Seeds = Plants …. This is the most simple way to explain our concept. Crypto Plant Club will release 2 types of NFTs. The first will be NFTs of pots and the second will be NFTs of seed packets. When you own a Pot NFT and a Seed Packet NFT you can combine them during one of the 4 growing seasons each year to grow a Plant NFT.     There will be set days each season (Winter, Summer, Fall, Spring) when you will be able to combine your seeds and pots to start growing your plants. You cannot grow plants outside of these seasons. We also will use the growing seasons to release new pots and new seed packets 4 times a year for 5 years. Each year we will release fewer seed packets and fewer pots each growing season. There will be a set number of Pots and Seed packets that will be announced in the official whitepaper. Much like a cryptocurrency that has a set number of tokens that can be mined we will have a set number of plants that can be grown over the 5-year grow.    https://preview.redd.it/pa9ppqh3thc81.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c79c40b2811b2ac51693c1ac0e66627cfcf713a",0.9146,0.0,0.921,0.079

"I'm dropping a new project on April 1st. If you're familiar with Blockchain Miners Club, then you're familiar with this concept. Some things that we have already in place give us a substantial advantage for mining. We own 100 acres in Northern Texas. We are in a commercial/residential zone so we can get power @ 8 per kwh. My father owns Midnite Solar in Arlington WA giving us access to engineers and parts at a dramatically reduced rate. 150k plus followers on tiktok, but I need a real community. My tiktok followers are great, but they don't engage. I want to make this happen with people that are excited about the direction and the opportunity. I'm fully doxxed. Even down to my address. This will be our second community rig, just much bigger in size. The project is called ""The Bitcoin Minors"" . If you don't have the money to play in the Majors, Join us in the Minors!

There is also 2.5% fee on sale price. My question is, after all the fee's are considered, is what left the actual profit you can get?  Is it List price - (minting fee + 2.5% sale fee) = profit?",0.9176,0.015,0.853,0.132

1. **Authentic art** : Let this animated PFP and the music do the talking for me. 2. **Their tight-knit community** : Entering the cord was hard. Real hard. Everyone who got in really wanted to. It shows tremendously in the quality of the interactions I see there. This is the kind of community you want to be part of for the long run. 3. **They are methodical in how they give out WL** : Many projects hand out WL like candy. This kind of behavior remove their scarcity and tend to create flippers at launch. The WL of PXN have real value. This will show trough a successful launch. HODL this one.  *Processing video 2efx414d9an81...*,0.9201,0.023,0.837,0.14
"Hello, I am new to NFT and want to ask several questions. If you dont want to answer, do you have a good source video or youtube that explain everything? I tried to join NFT channel on chat app but it is written level is too high. I watched a youtube video that explain I should try to use polygon for avoiding gas fee. I tried that but I dont think people is notice about my art. Then I heard from an acquintance, he told me he is now working in a team. He said he join a wh1t3l1st and buy NFT and sell it again. Unfortunately he doesnt want to answer anymore. What does it mean? He told me he sold his NFT through ethereum and not polygons. If I see NFT it seems collections is more popular rather than a single separate art? Is this a trend?  Thank you so much for answering.

"Hi guys, my name is Jack and I've been active here on reddit for a while, mostly I'm promoting my nfts and what motivates me the most is the financial part, because I'm in dire need of money.  I know that people with money solve everyday problems and that there is a problem in fact I am here in an attempt to make a sale or get it. What motivated me to go to this digital world was an infiltration that took place in my house and the repair cost around 12K-15k reais, which is a little over U$ 2.3K.  I live in Brazil and my English is not good at all, so there may be errors in this text. I'm making money in different ways whenever a new difficulty comes up, late rent, my sister's medicine, food and other bills.  I'm a university with 100% scholarship, so I can't work formally because if the income increases, college cuts my scholarship. That's why I try to write some articles for a company on the internet that works with AdSense, they pay me in reais, which in dollars is about U$3-4 per day. It helps a lot, but it's not enough to solve infiltration problems or change your life.  I'm trying to live with the problems and solve them very well, because my mom has been through the whole thing and I want to know what she's waiting for, but I have to take a turn on my mom and make her proud.  What I'm going is not alms I ask you to give a piece, in my arts on OpenSea and if you are interested buy it. In case you need a video editor, I can edit in Sony Vegas and I can also learn anything related to the internet and the computer.  I will leave a link to collaborations and my collection on OpenSea, as well as my profile on Instagram and Twitter, in addition to the photos of the infiltration.

This is why cryptocurrencies are becoming more popular, simply because a virtual world requires some form of virtual currency. Although crypto is more than just virtual money, it will continue to be the most widely utilized currency on these networks.  To be more specific, decentralized game tokens, such as Citrus, are the most often used. So, after the overall rise of cryptocurrencies this year, I believe gaming is one of the sectors that increased the most.",0.923,0.0,0.881,0.119

"So this is a noob question I'm sure. I'm in the process of designing 5k generative NFTs. I have most of the artwork done, but what I don't understand is how I list them for sale.   Some NFT sites link to a ""mint yours now!"" button and others link to Opensea. So are those sites with the mint button dodging the minting costs and directing it on to the buyer? If I upload 5,000 individually to Opensea do I have to pay a gas fee for every single one of them to have them minted or is it a one time fee for a collection?   I'm not trying to involve a smart contract with mine because of all the headache involved. I'm just 1 person who had a passionate idea.

"I have only recently started reading up on NFTs and I would like some clarity on one of its aspects.  An NFT is highly valued because only one true copy of it can exist and anyone who owns it, becomes the sole owner of such ""original"" copy. Thus, the ownership of an NFT doesn't arise from any right but arises out of design.  The owner of an NFT can allow others to use such NFT and in a way license it. If every NFT has a unique identification code, then wouldn't the copies of the NFTs that are legitimately licensed also carry a unique code?

" Identification, certification and documentation Although personal identity management is one area in which NFTs can shine, it's still early days for this type of application. As NFTs contain code with a unique set of information, they can be used to tokenize documentation such as degrees, academic certificates, licenses and other qualifications as well as medical records, birth and death certificates.   The identity or certification can be issued directly over the blockchain as an NFT, which can be traced back to the owner. So, employing NFTs to digitally store and protect medical history, personal profiles, education and address details gives users better control of their data and can help prevent identity theft.  Incorporated in social media platforms Some blockchain based platforms like Elysium offer users access to NFTs created by international influencers. People can mint their content into NFTs and sell to their followers for a lot.   Some social media platforms are even incorporating metaverse features into their architecture.   Domain name ownership With a blockchain domain system, owners can control their domains using private keys. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) controls the standard domain name service (DNS) and there is limited oversight of these domains. This raises concerns about censorship and security.

The objective was to create 5 families of dragons (earth/air/sea/fire/dark) to which are added sub-families with rarer attributes. Some families have a larger population than others. You won't find a hat/glasses..., only one species can have a tool, but what will distinguish them is above all their fur color, their shape, their name, their personality and their gender.  There are 5 types of cards depending on the habitat of the dragons, the frame of the card changes according to the dragon represented. You will find the name of the animal as well as its description.  The color of the fur, cannot reproduce more than 25 times, and there are 61 unique colors among all the cards. There are a total of 1694 fur colors. In the end, no dragon can be identical to another.  The project is recent, it started at the end of 2021, currently the uploading of the cards is done gradually on Opensea.

"This is something I have always wondered. When an nft drops, and there is the period after minting but before release, how are the NFTs assigned to a number? The only two things I can think of is that they are pre-determined and fixed to a number, or that every time the metadata is refreshed, it picks a random one out of the ones that have yet to be given when another one was refreshed. If so, does that, in theory, mean that if there is a collection of 10,000 NFTs, with say 10 1 of 1 pieces, and 2000 had they're metadata refreshed without getting a 1 of 1, that you would have a better chance to get one if you waited to refresh yours until that point? (10/10,000 vs 10/8,000) Or is that irrelevant because they are each fixed to a certain number already (I know in theory if that scenario happened you still have a better chance of having a 1 of 1 even if they were predetermined. This is somewhat meaningless but I have always really wondered how this worked.",0.928,0.019,0.871,0.111

"I'll give a bit of a story with how this became a thing.     My daughter (15) has decent drawing ability. My wife and I have tried to nurture her skills as much as we can. I've taught her different techniques over the years (I have an AAS in visual communication) and have bought her tons of books based on her preferences (kawaii, anime, chibi, etc.), got her top-notch software (ClipStudio Paint), a decent tablet (Wacom One) and she's been just drawing and developing her techniques.  It sounds great. But... now we'll move on to the bad part of the story. Recently, my wife has been diagnosed with a chronic illness (we don't know what yet, we're still pending on the specialist referral from her primary care provider), and has missed a lot of work. My own shop has been in decline because of... not necessarily Covid, but logistical issues due to it. So, money has been tight lately to say the least. My daughter wanted to help and offered to draw some art if I wanted to post them as NFTs. My wife and I gave her a list of stuff to draw, and I researched the easiest way to do a generative project and stumbled across Autominter. I made sure I tagged everything, everything had rarities, etc. and made the project. Below is the link to the minting page, if anyone is ever so inclined. No one has to buy anything (it's on Polygon), but I'm more or less just trying to spread the word. We've sold a few, and it's made my daughter's day because in her eyes, she's helping my wife and I out.

Mohan noted:  *“For example, offering a verifiable way for fans to own videos, photos, art, and even unique experiences from their favorite creators could be a compelling prospect for creators and their audiences.

" A few months ago I found a project   online that at first made me pretty  happy, pretty excited actually. A   project called 'Revomon VR' that had  been designed by the same team for   Pokemon VR, a wildly popular  Sidequest game that allowed players to  go  through the Kanto region from  Pokemon, with all species available.   Revomon however, was  incorporating NFTs and Cryptocurrency, and a  'Play  to Earn' feature. It  sounds incredible on the surface, but there  are  many issues under the  hood.  There   is no further  negative criticism on the project aside from the   occasional upset  comment on their Twitter, but this is not because it  is  a good product.  Most people playing the project are almost under a   trance at times.  They will not think beyond the point that this  project  is a beta and  that NFTs are still gaining headway in the  mainstream  audience, and  that excuses a percentage of the problems.  Game glitches,  spawn rates,  moves not working correctly, all of these  would be  excusable if the  product itself didn't try to rehash  everything from the  old project it  could without facing copyright.  The   Revomon are well designed, but the movesets, abilities, base stats,  sometimes typing, and learnable TMs with the exception of several lines    are cut and paste from Pokemon, this includes the starters being exact    replicas of the Kanto Pokemon starters. Gorcano is Fire/Rock, why can   it  learn Roost and Wing Attack? Many moves outright don't work, and    despite this being known for months there have been no adjustments. How    do we know how they are supposed to work? Oh right, their  descriptions   have been copied from Pokemon as well. There are few  exceptions to the   lazy templates or inspirations the team is using,  and though they are   making more unique designs, if I was an investor I  would feel very   discouraged by the starting Revomon being Legend of  Zelda references   with those aforementioned red flags. Gorlit, Zorelle,  and Dekute?   Looking like a Goron, Zora, and Deku Nut? Another red  flag. It seems   like they're putting in just enough effort to avoid  copyright lawsuits.   Some Revomon are glitched 3 months after  introduction, and cannot be   leveled up (Frostoast).  https://preview.redd.it/1j68v1hs8mj81.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18bc05328f6e114badd08c2b8b01ab22de7a5e34  Legendaries  had started as being a potentially profitable venture, the first one    sold for around $10,000.00 but now four is worth a burnable price of    $400.00, this was driven solely by the players and their flooding of the three maps (of which only 6/10 are actually zones with spawns) where    legendaries spawn at a rate of 1 in 1000, but decreases with each player on  the map. With the amount of people seeking solely these Revomon,  the game would very easily lag, chaos would ensue, and crashes would be  common with only 6+ people on the map at once. How does this project   expect to handle hundreds of players? They say it's a map size issue,    but that only handles player density not what the servers can handle.  The  community can be hostile in-game, players would cover spawns with the    models of their Revomon to prevent others from catching spawns, they    would consistently teleport to one another, or yell and curse when a  rare, shiny, or legendary was found.  Its not uncommon to hear of those    who would cycle through these same maps for 6+ hours a day and then  lie to others about the money potential, just to get more hype for the   game  and maybe drive the price higher. However, from .92 at it's start,   the  currency itself has dipped down to .32 after a abrupt  announcement  from  the head development team that burning values for  Shinies was  being cut  by half ($200 for 4).  This  tore the community, as there was no explicit mention of a floor price  being altered only a month after the burn feature was introduced; and   several other blunders that will be covered; and no announcement prior   to the  rate change so people could take advantage of one more day of   normal  trading costs.  The team  has had numerous drops, with each having a different Achilles tendon.  The  first drop was first come, first serve with a flat rate;  but  these  sold out like crazy and several people took the majority of the  limited Revomon. The second faced issues with Refinable, a  repeating   thorn in everyone's side, where they were placed for bid but did not  show up  properly in normal listings. In many cases, one would need a   direct link  to the seller in order to bid. For new players whom hadn't   touched this  system yet, they were at an immediate disadvantage.   Refinable and  Revomon VR had an issue soon after these listings, where all minted NFTs  vanished in-game, and NFT listings weren't being   updated correctly, so a  lot of information was incorrect and many listings were missing  entirely. Refinable started to ban individuals   from their community server  who reached out for support, eventually the   problem was fixed but the  entire matter felt very unprofessional.  There haven't been too many issues with cosmetics, mainly because cosmetics are locked to only those holding large amounts of Revo currency.  With   this in mind, and  the statements of individuals on their team such as 'Sora', the funds  and proceeds from $Revo go directly back into the   game. If this is the  case, and they are having this many issues already,   I question if  they can even make a functional economy and a successful   coin. They  seem to have taken the base lessons learned from Pokemon VR   and  instead of trying to make a good game, they just wanted to make a    quick buck. The team themselves have stated that they were a small team    and were struggling to hire further developers, but would not clarify   if  it was a financial issue or just a lack of good candidates.  It   is insanely difficult to actually get $Revo and when you do, you have  limited options as to what to use it on besides monthly egg drops that    require injecting it with currency, and packs that are overpriced and    give a free legendary MOST of the time. It costs $50USD Revo equivalent    for the Rev-Up Revomon that is required for you to even touch the NFT    portion, and even then you're better off just grabbing one off  Refinable   at a discount. Buying Revo requires going through BNB,  TrustWallet, or   another resource for Binance, and then uses MetaMask  or Uniswap, the   problem is BNB holds your cash for 10 days in the US,  and some regions   can't use some of these exchanges. It takes hours to  fully get the   process moving, and really just pulls you right back out  of the crypto   aspect.  On the  topic of graphics  and gameplay, it's what I would expect. Aim 'Orbs' to  catch Revomon,   Battle if you so wish, Run if you don't want to do  either and another Revomon spawns. This ends up causing hours upon  hours of the same arm   motion and running from everything in sight just  to try to get a rare   spawn, because the lock system makes it so you  may not get one unless   you clear enough. On that same topic, if a  Revomon is locked to you but   you don't reach it in time, others can  grab it. This can be done with   rares, legendaries, or any other  Revomon in the game. Many times a   search will continue for several  extra hours due to someone else grabbing an expensive rare tagged to  you.  PVP   is fun, except the  majority of people run the same 6 - 7 Revomon most   of the time and XY  (Sometimes Sun/Moon) Smogon tactics work unless you need Taunt, Baton  Pass, or any number of functional non-damaging moves.   Some, such as  Sucker Punch don't work at all. If you're going to rip   something off,  at least make sure that it works.  The   majority of cities and zones are small but well designed (minus the    seasonal map being a direct copy/paste but with snow ), minus the   massive level jump from around level 5 to level 20 between the first and    second cities, and no healing in the second city but no mart in the    first city. Love the logic here, make your players consistently run  back   and forth or just catch the very same things again but leveled  up. The   Day/Night function works well and the timed spawns are quite  welcomed.  All   in all, it's an  alright proof of concept and I have confidence in this   team to  eventually create a good game, but the NFT and cryptocurrency   aspect  needs to be pushed aside. The game can't support as many players   as it  wants to reach and $120,000/month in crypto earnings from the    community was apparently more than it could sustain, resulting in the    drop of the value of shinies.  The attention needs diverted, the designs and Revomon need a full  overhaul,   and the development team needs to focus on making a good  product, not a   good economy solely. What economy will be there if  there's nobody to   play the game? ""Truly own what you earn"" is a  commonly stated slogan,   but this is a lie in and of itself if as  evidenced, those same NFTs you   'own' can go up in smoke at a moment's  notice. Hopefully the developers   can pull their head out their ass  before the project becomes just   another Nintendo lawsuit, or another  Youtube video about a dead game.  https://preview.redd.it/sp0muvit8mj81.jpg?width=934&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=899072208d463c21b86fa0bf0365f0b27899d3b1",0.9312,0.083,0.825,0.093

Hence i am posting this here for some advice from you all.    Coming to the point i want to sell some of my digital drawings (i am not very good at it but it's my hobby and i have drawn for quite some years now to kill time) as nft. I already registered on opensea and have tried to sell it at auction but it didn't sold. But it's a big marketplace so i guess it is very hard for a newbie like me without a social media following or prior recognition to sell right away so i have decided to sell it on some smaller platforms. I am attaching a sample from my collection (unminted at this time) to you guys and i am telling the price i am thinking to sell it at. Kindly help me in correcting the price or telling me a fitting price for it. Some tips on how to sell it or increase it's chances of selling are extremely appreciated. Please suggest me some good marketplaces as well.     Thanks in advance for taking your time to read all this text and i will be very greatful for your advice.

"A collection of non-fungible tokens has just received its own fungible token.  Yuga Labs, the startup behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection, has taken another step forward to build a crypto empire around the most expensive NFT collection to date. The startup has now adopted the newly created ApeCoin as the official currency of the BAYC ecosystem.  Interestingly, the startup went to great lengths to disassociate itself from the creation and operation of the token. ApeCoin is being created by ApeCoin DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization with Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, Amy Wu of FTX, Yat Siu of Animoca Brands, Maaria Bajwa of Sound Ventures, and Dean Steinbeck of Horizen Labs.  Those who wish to be a part of ApeCoin DAO need only have a supply of the token. Each token holder will participate in the governance process and vote on the use of the ecosystem fund.

"I would say that something that is is shaking up the traditional online gaming sector is definitely GameFi! GameFi is transforming online gaming as we know it by combining DeFi, NFTs, and blockchain technology aspects.     The P2E concept, which is common in GameFi projects, is groundbreaking. In-app purchases, affiliate marketing, and advertising are all ways for traditional online games to generate money. As a player, you spend money on in-game things that will help you win or give you an advantage over other players. Of course, that money goes directly to the game developers.     Furthermore, if you're like most gamers who grew up with video games like Need for Speed and Colin McRae, you've probably heard of NFT games like F1 or the first rally blockchain game - K4. I enjoy playing all of these games since the time you spend playing your favorite games is transformed into money. Isn't it crazy?     Because it is a Play-To-Earn game, you can only earn money by playing it. And the more you play, the more money you will make. That seems even more insane, but it's real!  What are your thoughts on this type of gaming?",0.9338,0.017,0.857,0.126

An NFT is a unique and non-interchangeable unit of data stored on a digital ledger. NFTs can be used to represent easily-reproducible items such as photos, videos, audio, and other types of digital files as unique items, and use blockchain technology to establish a verified and public proof of ownership. Each NFT acts much the same way as a deed to a house, a note on a car, a license for an action, protection for intellectual property, and as certificates of authentication.  For the project, NFTs minted into the Elysian Field collection will act as passports to the Metaverse as well as to populate it. Possession of a passport grants membership to the DAO and is required for entry to Elysian Fields. Users can hold more than one passport, but only one is required to remain in possession to retain membership. The wallet that holds their passport will be connected to the Metaverse and act as their user ID on the blockchain.

Im trying to work out the best way to release the 365 images I have, and was wondering if anyone here had any input?

"Hi NFT lovers,  I recently had a problem with a transaction on the ethereum network and after some thinking I found a solution.  This solution does not yet exist as a separate application and I think that by building such an application, anyone who wants to participate in this will have a lot of fun and possibly also earn good money.  The idea is as follows:  You want to send a message to an ethereum address (but this can also be extended to Solana eg) but that is not provided by default because there is no messaging app.   If you now make the message as NFT (as an image) and send it to that ethereum address, it will be in his NFT collection which is then visible via rarible or opensea.

"So, NFTs don't contain assets; they are links to assets, digital or real.  As such, they contain a URL that points to the asset.  However, anyone who has worked with URLs knows that there isn't a one-to-one mapping of URLs to assets. You can have as many as you like pointing to a single asset.  On top of that, if access to the assert is over HTTP, then you can layer 300 status codes to provide redirects on any of these URLs.  So, while URLs are not _perfectly_ fungible, they are highly fungible and unlimitedly so (in principle).  So this leads me to my question: if an NFT is based on a fungible reference and you can create two unique NFTs that reference the same asset, doesn't that undermine their fungibility?  To be clear, I'm not talking about different NFTs pointing to identical copies (although that's problematic). I'm talking to URLs that are pointing to exactly the same asset.",0.9364,0.027,0.849,0.124

"I (18 y/o) minted my first ever NFT for approximately 300$ (including gas) a couple days ago after countless hours of watching YouTube videos and even paying someone on Fiver to teach me. I obviously came to the conclusion that flipping NFTs was much harder than I expected. Even with now only 300 bucks in my bank account, I still want to learn and improve myself.   - What did I do wrong? The twitter page looked okay to me and their website was pretty professional and looked promising to me.  - Is there a way to at least make some of my money back?   I'm not here to complain, but to learn. Here is the link to the NTF that I minted. The price I put is too high and I know it.

"Hi! I would like to get your opinion about a concept we try to integrate into our game. After some research and personal experiences, we discovered a black market for selling different game accounts from well know publishers (Steam, Ubisoft, Clash of clans). Their policy is against such practices and we understand them.   We want to let users trade their accounts (their progress in the game) and get crypto in return. In this way, players with hard-worked accounts and thousand of hours involved would earn some crypto. (we believe this is truly ""play to earn""). Every account will be an NFT with a unique id that at the moment would be linked with game progress from our database.  What do you think about this concept?

We have just added our first collection :  [falsifiedreality](https://opensea.io/collection/falsifiedreality)   My sister has always been in a bubble since birth, with very limited social interactions. As a brother, I always supported her against anyone who could make fun of her as she was different. However, the most effective way she found to escape has always been drawing.   She has a very particular style, not pleasing everyone. I always told her that she was talented but how to prove it to her?   We recently saw a report on the NFT and the idea came together: to create a page by putting his drawings online in order to circulate them around the world.  Especially since I love the world of cryptocurrency I talk about a lot with her (she is getting bored aha).  She doesn’t want to do exhibitions in real life because she really thinks her style can’t please people. What do you think about that?  Why 5 copies of each drawing? We do not hide that the financial side also comes into play. Because of her phobia for social interactions, she lost her job a short time ago and it is very difficult for her to find a job now, even more with covid.

"""Flight"" is a mixed technique NFT painting combining watercolor on paper and a digital brush. The idea came from painting using watercolor on cold pressed paper (cotton based), leaving for some time, and coming back to see my dog eating a piece of it. That gave me the inspiration to continue it in a different manner, so it was scanned and finished digitally. That's why it has a distinctive look.

"So, I'm new to this NFT stuff I'll just get that out there. I've been doing a butt-load of research as far as what they are, how the block chain works, crypto in general, etc... I've got a pretty good handle on that part. Now I'm curious about creating actual content.   I've noticed an awful lot of collections that are basically just one character in different outfits, or a scene in multiple time/weather states, 25 species of mushroom, etc...    I have seen some works that were just one or two pieces, but these(in my experience so far) usually are rarer and tend to be some intricate and next-level creations. Even then a lot of them seem to be part of larger collections.    So basically I'm wondering, in your experience both as creators and collectors what seems to do better?Collections or standalone pieces? Do you notice a difference? Is it more based on subject matter and quality?    Myself I'm a cartoonist and an abstract painter, and I am working on some material I plan on turning into NFTs.

"I got into an argument with a friend last night after I told him he wasted his money buying an NFT. His response was he was getting ahead of the game since most digital products will become NFTs in the next decade and this was a long term investment. This is also a reason I have heard from many influencers use as a reason to invest in a project.  While I can see the logic behind why a lot of digital assets will become NFTs in the future, what I don’t get is how stub hub selling NFT tickets will raise the price of the art. The value of the ticket will not change just because it’s an NFT, it’s still set by the artists popularity. This whole art bubble feels more like a POC for these mega corporations, than a world changing movement like it’s championed to be by some.

As an example, let's use reddit (and pretend it plans to stay private)  Could reddit distribute an nft that functions also as a qr code that links to a legally binding document that sells a share of reddit to the person who signs and files it, and give them only to the people who watch the most ads, buy the most awards, and earn the most karma?

In my opinion, NFTs are something you should definitely pay more attention to in 2022. A lot of people are predicting many different things we are going to be using NFTs in the future, for example, some of them think that we won't be using boarding passes to get onto a plane but we will be using an NFT. After doing some research about upcoming NFT projects, I came across some companies that are using NFTs in their projects. One of those companies is Meteora. They want to implement this idea where, from what I've understood, you can simply sell your music master and its ownership contract as a traditional NFT. In my opinion, this could be a great project in 2022 because I think that we will be using NFTs a lot more in the future.

"🎄 For Christmas, let's explore the `$LUCHA` token from Luchadores NFT.  `$LUCHA` is the ERC20 token of the 100% onchain play-to-earn upcoming game Luchadores.io (available on Q1 2022). In this fighting game, players (= Luchas) will fight each other for glory in the arena. 10,000 Luchadores NFTs were minted via ChainLink VRF this year.  `$LUCHA` **Tokenomics** :  * **Scarcity** : the only way to mint `$LUCHA`    is through the 1 year yield or by winning battles. Each time a player wins a battle, he will be rewarded with `$LUCHA`. The minting began yesterday (12/23/2021) * **Usage** : as players invest time battling with their Luchadores, they will level up and Luchas will be able to spend `$LUCHA` tokens to increase their stats. $LUCHA can be used for the following features : Governance / Increasing Luchador stats / Learning new skills / Purchasing wearables ... * **Secondary market / LP** : new pools are live since yesterday (12/23/2021) on Cometh and Quickswap (better using ParaSwap to find the cheaper route). Liquidity is very low atm since it's inception. We can easily anticipate huge flows once the game start (Q1 2022). Players will be keen on buying more and more `$LUCHA` on these DEX to increase their game stats.  ⚡️ It's the very very beginning, it's worth having a deep look at the game withepaper to anticipate the `$LUCHA`upcoming price mooning.",0.9413,0.063,0.809,0.128

"We have all known cryptocurrencies for some time now, but since 2020 a new 'hype' has arisen, the NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). This new hot topic is ready to take over the online world. But can the NFT market function independently without the crypto coins? And vice versa, can the NFTs be ignored when we talk about cryptos?  I think that the crypto world and the NFT world are increasingly merging as one. And personally, I think this is a good development for both markets. They will both be strengthened by this, and more people will find their way through this 'new' merged world.  There are so many projects right now, such as Women Empowerment Token, The Sandbox, and White Whale Terra, waiting to soar to great heights. All projects based on the creation, purchase, and sale of NFTs. It might sound a bit scary for most of us, but after all, I think it all will be worth it!",0.9418,0.042,0.832,0.127

I believe the next big wave of NFTs that flood the market will be music-related ones. We have seen it start with the ChillRx project which is cool but still seems like a money grab but a major producer. There is one early project (really early) my friend introduced me to that NFTs beat stems/loops of songs so other artists can use it and immediately have fans involved with their music.

Next year we got to the world final of International Chocolate Awards, and in 2015 we even got to be world champions; we were growing quickly. Sadly during 2019 we took a shot to open our own store and we all know what happened afterwards, pandemic stroke and we had to close, we lost around 40k USD and since the store was financed we went bankrupt. Had to sell our equipment, tools, everything just to repay the debt partially.      Now we are trying to start over so we are selling our brand's art pieces to help us start over, all pieces were created by incredibly talented artist Diana Vigo. So I am auctioning all of our pieces (auctions will be 30days with 3 days difference each), tokens not only include access to original assets in PSD but also represent a **sole licence for commercial use**.     https://preview.redd.it/rrejgxg9kig81.png?width=5761&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10591bb70356b2bdcf3ebcdc491936bedf38d171    *Processing img uaojzi8bkig81...*  You can check out how these arts were used before here    [Dreams of Eva on Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/31660303/Dreams-of-Eva)   If you also need to confirm identity or something you can get in touch through Dreams of Eva's accounts on facebook and instagram so you can confirm this is real.",0.9431,0.032,0.853,0.115
"Because of private collector capital and institutional investment, the growth of NFT avatars has the potential to skyrocket. Visa, for example, paid $150,000 for the Cryptopunk NFT ""Digital avatar With Mohawk."" Positive feedback has also been received for a number of other NFT avatar projects. The Penguin NFT Club sold a Pudgy Penguin for $469,00. Ten thousand Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs were sold the day they were released.  The owner's digital status is also reflected in an NFT avatar. The price of an original CryptoPunks avatar, for example, has skyrocketed due to the hype surrounding it since its release. Having and displaying an NFT Punk for such a high price implies that the owner has made a significant investment in NFTs. As part of the evolving NFT phenomenon, users of other NFT avatars also reflect a sense of digital identity.  The foundation of the metaverse – a digital world with its own identity, audience, and governance – is a community, which is at the heart of NFT avatars.  As evidenced by the various use cases of NFT avatar collections, NFT avatars are gradually maturing in this regard. Additional features such as royalties, character upgrades, and gamification are being incorporated into a number of projects.   These are well-known projects with a strong chance of succeeding in the metaverse. However, I believe that in the not-too-distant future, having a nft profile picture will become fashionable. Twitter, and Reddit have all joined the trend, despite the fact that it is still in its early stages.  This will no longer be limited, as social media behemoths have jumped in, and an increasing number of people will use the NFt as an avatar. And a tool like NFt avatar maker, which lets you customise NFT in a variety of ways, might be able to assist you.  This type of tool could aid in the spread of NFt avatars on social media.   ",0.9432,0.019,0.902,0.079
Meaning don’t look simply at their price and think this is their value.  A lot of NFTs most popular of which are Bored Apes and most recently Last Hopium NFTs offer exculusive access to place where you could meet with people of high influence and power.  This is great added value. With this kind of exclusivity you can easily expand your network.  I think more and more NFTs should start moving towards this direction of utility especially considering that NFTs derive their value from exclusivity.

"So, I'm reading a bit and trying to get a grasp on NFT's, as my primary income is through art (music production and DJing). If I were to make my next album an NFT, would I have the rights to my own album still?

I started scouting on OpenSea to see what it’s like to buy an NFT, see the prices, etc. I had a couple questions on concepts that I have a hard time understanding. If someone could help me that would be so kind !  1. If I see the name of someone as the owner of the NFT on OpenSea, just under the NFT, why does an other name appears in « offers » ? Shouldn’t it be the seller, so the owner, that fixes the price in the « offers » section, so the buyers can buy the NFT by placing bids ? 2. Why does the person appearing in the « offer » section doesn’t appear in the « item activity » section like the owners of the NFT ? 2. Why is the « minimum bid » section so high compared to the « offer » ?   Thank you very much for taking time to read and answer all this !",0.9433,0.008,0.894,0.098

" Crypto games provide players with an additional source of income. Gamers who use a play-to-earn strategy can earn money in a variety of ways. A good example is Axie Infinity. Axes can be purchased, levelled up, and then sold for a higher price. Players can also compete for SLP and AXS, Ethereum-based crypto gaming tokens, by using their Axies.  Crypto gaming makes the most sense for those who already work with cryptocurrencies. You may want to gamble in secret or keep your trades hidden from your bank (or the government). Crypto gaming will most likely remain a niche hobby until cryptocurrency becomes more widely accepted.  You play a game, usually with an NFT character that you purchase, and you earn tokens for your wins and achievements, which you can then exchange for cash. Axis infinity is a good example of this type of game. The crypto gaming community is growing, and I believe it will result in significant gains. There are projects in place to combat this crypto gaming phenomenon, where people can buy and trade crypto gaming NFts and tokens all in one place.

"Dont get me wrong I love NFTs. They’re really projecting crypto into the mainstream world. However, its kinda frustrating that a lot of utility behind NFTs ends up being ignored completely.    NFTs have many uses one of which is the music industry where artists no longer need record labels (which usually take up to 90% of the artist’s profits) in order to make it. They can also cut out the middle man when it comes to concert tickets and sell them as NFTs which would cut down on unneeded expenses.    There are also P2E games which to be fair have been gaining popularity recently but nowhere near JPEGs which is crazy considering you could actually make profits off of entertaining games like Mecha Morphing and have fun while doing so. Why isn’t this more viral?    There’s also the fact that you could make passive income off of renting out your NFT if its like one of those Last Hopium NFTs from Habtoor that offer access to many important contacts, restaurants and hotels.

"If you're here, I know you've got at least a few NFTs stacked in a digital corner somewhere and gathering pixel dust. Here's something you might want to take a look at to add to that growing collection: MixMob. They're not just any NFT. These ones are mutable and play a big part in their P2E game. They're masks that your avatar wears in game. Also, you get to customize them with cosmetics that you can either earn or buy in game.   But what would be the point? Well, as for all games, fashion is always the endgame. The better looking your mask, the better you play (maybe?) But if you manage to earn rare cosmetics and put them on your mask, you may be able to sell your NFT for a higher price later on. The possibilities endless here.

"Hey NFT Reddit!  My name is Tommy Drinkard. I am a music producer and multi instrumentalist based in LA.   Still on the come up but I have been starting to get small jobs as a session musician and audio engineering for some pretty big artists such as Travis Barker, Tim Timebomb, Mondo Cozmo, Mike Herrera and more.  During the pandemic I was locked inside with my roomates who are musicians and did a ton of live-streaming.   At one point while we were extremely stoned we created a show called Producing the Internet.  On Producing the Internet, my friends and I started co-writing songs with our small but die hard fan base.   I would start recording music, fans would comment lyrics, we would write melody to go with their words, record the vocals, and then we’d have a song.  Originally, we were releasing the songs onto Spotify and YouTube and registering the fans who commented as legal co-writers of the song.  Then lot of life stuff hit me hard, and I had to take a break.   However, recently I decided to bring the show back with a new addition.  The NFT component.  The new idea is to create an NFT of the song every Monday, and auction it off 2 weeks later.  Anyone who leaves 3 comments with lyrics on the stream gets equal ownership of the the NFT.  Not really sure how it will all turn out.  My dream is create a song with as many people online as possible.   And get hundreds of thousands of people paid for writing music and making art.  And eventually bring on the biggest artists in the world onto the show to make NFTs to share with their fans.  It’ll be a new kind of song, written by the Internet.   All we have to do is start writing together!  Tune in Mondays 4pm PST. Search Producing the Internet - Tommy Drinkard on YouTube, twitch, Facebook to find the stream!",0.9451,0.034,0.883,0.083

So while it's the LimeWire name and branding that many of us are nostalgic about, it's really a new company that hopes to use the LimeWire name to attract new people to the NFT ecosystem.  You may not have known this part, but the service intends to obscure some of the more complex parts of crypto from the users. It's completely centralized, first and foremost, and will show prices of NFTs in USD by default so that users who are new to crypto don't have to navigate the complexities of Ethereum and the fluctuating exchange rates. To take that a step further, they'll be able to directly purchase NFTs with a credit card.   So how do we feel about this? On one hand, I can see how this could easily onboard a lot of new people into the space who have previously been timid about crypto, but on the other hand I worry that making NFTs *too* easily accessible could expose newcomers to scams that they aren't at all prepared for.

For the first time in NFTs’ history, the rarity of the pieces will be defined by the community. The +1 is the Masterpiece that will be sold in auction after the public mint of the other 2000.

"Sail Away 1st Edition NFTs are on their way, you can pre-purchase them now!     These SailBoats and locations have been generated with AI and have total possible combinations to 8 398 080 Unique NFTs. Only 1000 will be generated out of this edition. Some of these have very rare layer occurrences (1%). So rarity is a huge thing for these Sailboats.      The revenue generated from the first edition will be used to support Ukraine and develop the next edition of Sail Away boats. During the minting process, 10% is sent directly to  Ukraine. The remainder will be pooled up and at the end, another 10% will be sent to Ukraine or charitable organizations supporting the displaced population. The remainder of the crypto generated will be used to get the 2nd edition out and send 20% to Ukraine.     You may not wish to own a sailboat so you can always just get one and give it to someone else with the knowledge that you are supporting a good cause will be worth the 0.005 Eth you use. The Sail Away collection is set to be released and revealed on March 5th at midnight.      These were made at a low price to ensure anyone can donate to this cause and be a part of the Sail Away community!",0.9468,0.019,0.885,0.096

" I have turned my father’s archaeological collection into an NFT so that his most important treasure would not be destroyed to pay off the debts (becaose he left debts too). There are only 37 of them, but many have an interesting history and many details in the description.If you will have these NFTs you can optionally send items based on them to museum (if you wish). You will also find out the approximate place of their origin and get the opportunity to get more photos / videos (or 3d model maybe) of these items or talk to me about archeological stuff. Recently, I was really sick, which is why I have problems with work. Morally, I'm ready to give up, but I don't want my father’s work to be so mediocrely destroyed, because this is the last thing I have left of him. Therefore, if you are not interested, but you have friends who are interested in this, please tell them!

"Much has been said on Reddit about NFTs and possible applications. People are starting to realise there is much more to NFTs than Apes, Punks and Rocks. You see serious brands and companies jumping on NFTs and leveraging its potential.  I have been a big fan of NFT Ticketing, which seem to be in vogue given the attention it received from the likes of Vitalik, Snoop, Cuban - just to name a few. Many projects are trying to kick off a NFT Ticketing project and are in different stages of maturity. So far I think **GET Protocol** **(token: GET**) is the clear leader of the pack and next two years could be huge for them.  GET Protocol is being used by different integrators across the globe. Each ticket they sell will require a certain amount of GET, which is taken out of the circulation. The amount of GET is fixed, so we are looking at deflationary powers and a natural demand for the coin. The numbers are looking **VERY** impressive and with COVID finally behind us this could be a hidden gem with a market cap under 50m!  * Founded in 2016 * In October 2021 GET sold their 1M tickets * Total tickets sales in 2021: 560K * Tickets sales this quarter 259K * Ticket sales in the last 7 days: 38.2K  All is visisble onchain and it is one of the rare crypto projects with a real life usecase AND economics that make sense. If you do the math and extrapolate the growth it is hard not to get very bullish on this project.",0.9485,0.016,0.905,0.079
"I’ve been digging deep into the world of physically backed NFTs for a couple of months now. There are a few companies doing this but [4K](https://4k.com) stick out the most for me.  There’s a bit of a uniqueness with these types of NFTs since items like shoes, watches, wine, memorabilia, etc. already have ecosystems surrounding them and better yet, ecosystems that have shown to hold value. Tokenizing these items gives investors a lot more liquidity by being able to fractionalize and plug into DeFi. I’m pretty stoked to see how these types of NFTs change how we interact with real world assets.",0.9485,0.0,0.838,0.162

"(I had to censor a word as per the subreddit rules but I hope you still understand)  I am very new to crypto/NFTs (first discovered through Habbo Avatars like a month ago) so please excuse me if what I’m asking doesn’t really make sense, I’m just confused  When you come across a new NFT project from like Twitter or something, they usually have some competition going on to give out W**** L*** spots for minting one of their NFTs when they drop. I think I understand that part - they only allow certain addresses to mint at first so you connect your wallet to their site for a guaranteed mint in case they were to otherwise sell out instantly, I guess.  What I’m confused about is, when you mint you usually have to pay, say around .1-.3 ETH.  First, what is that money you spend minting doing and who is getting it?  Second, once you’ve minted it seems like some projects hide the NFT from you (it could appear grayed out in your MetaMask wallet for example) so when they all sell they are revealed at once. How do they change your blank NFT to the actual one, is it just some special code in the NFT or something?  And finally, what are some ways to identify scam projects, and what would a scam project entail exactly? Could there be malicious code that steals funds from your wallet when you connect it to their site hoping to mint? When you mint might they just never actually release the NFTs (kinda ties into question 1 if they are the ones receiving the mint money) and run off with the crypto?  Alright that’s all! Any info would be appreciated because I’m not gonna lie it’s all pretty intimidating right now haha",0.9486,0.095,0.765,0.14

"So I've been looking around different articles about previous rug pulls. I'm wanting to educate myself more about what is considered a rug pull in the NFT space. I've known of people wanting to sell NFTs on platforms like OpenSea, but I was under the assumption that people who create a collection want to make money from it. Are they allowed to pull profits from their sold NFTs? Or does it affect the collection somehow if they do?   A hypothetical: Let's say someone makes a collection of 5,000 items and lists them on OpenSea. About 1,000 of those sell, and the money goes to the wallet who created the project. If they cashed out, does that affect the collection and considered a rug pull? I was seeing liquidity thrown around too; I guess i'm just not entirely sure how this all goes together.

P.S, I am seeking NFTs for an investment, to resale and receive financial benefits, so it's essential for me to find the best NFT projects. Also, I am just getting started and don't know much about the marketplace. I got lucky several times and want to keep this up.   I would appreciate it if you could share your own tips for NFT fishing. ",0.9493,0.02,0.801,0.178

"1. Most NFTs are costing above 1000 dollars which is 100+ hours of hard work but 10,000 of these randomized NFT can be made in a very short span of time (Max 5-7 days). 2. The only viable use case of NFT is to do money laundering. 3. The value of NFT will exist only when there is hype and will crash when it's hype falls off. Example: Pudgy penguins,gutter cat gang might be hot right now but you can't tell the same after 5-10 years. If you think you can exit before the whole market crashes, Gluck on that.People who bought NFTs from celebs like grimes, John Cena has already lost 80%+ percentage of value. 4. You can create your custom digital art and make it your NFT for as little as 15-20 dollars.   In end I just want to say 90% of NFT is just going to lose 99% of it's value. The only NFTs that will survive are those with attached big brand names, genesis NFT of celebrities, Utility NFT of fun games and the ones with tangibility like the ability to be used like tickets.",0.9501,0.064,0.795,0.141

You would obviously get to keep the NFT and also be in the draw for the raffle.  This would help promote our nfts and get people ready for the virtual world. We could extend this and keep doing raffles if all goes well.  The winners prize would be sent directly to them at our cost.

"So it wasn’t long ago that I got into the NFT space and I’ve noticed mostly jpeg or png format style NFT’s are the ones leading the industry. But why hasn’t anyone talked more about the vast other types of files that can be imported?  I go to a few of those wild EDM festivals in the US every year and I always have a ton of footage that just eventually sits there after I’ve been through them many times. Knowing that MP4 files are allowed, that would then allow me to store my old clips on the blockchain right? Ok cool, but I know what you’re thinking. Wouldn’t the 50,000 other people that were recording do the exact same thing? Yes, but then if you’re looking to put those videos up for sale it’ll start to factor down to aspects such as  - video quality  - audio quality  - device used to record - composition - Metadata within picture ?

Why is  ETH the crypto currency being used? (Don't know much about crypto either) Is it more consistent than bitcoin or other big coins? Are there different cryptos you can use for most of them?   3. What's the main incentive to buy an NFT? Is it like a ""safer""  investment? Why not just invest in stocks/crypto?

""" I see a lot of people here and on other platforms, aimless and struggling to find hope in new projects after seeing their main investments crash in the bear market. It is often aimlessness is the worst way you can feel. It’s when you feel like you’re drowning and putting in effort will only make you drown faster in the depths.   Well, I’m sorry you had to hear this, but the work you’ve put in already, is not enough. You need to work harder, and research better. You need to offer this from your true intentions and not with greed and malevolence, but with passion, ambition and hope.   You need to put in work, and there’s no way around that yet. The market keeps users pushing for the same old 5 projects, discarding every other new idea out there. This is horrible, because new ideas because of this get banished and disregarded. Good and new ideas that their team in respective have put in a ton of time to work on and achieve.   It is most often, that the work you put in, will be returned to you at the right time.

"*Processing img 8xd1x8got2881...*  NoFace Project represents the duality of being. Light and darkness. East and West. Reality and the Metaverse. It represents the balance between our real selves as opposed to the mask that  we wear everyday.    We believe this duality exists in every aspect of existence.     This project features a limited collection of 8,256 Hand-drawn Mask NFTs. The project features 12 mini-series inspired by Zodiac Mythology &amp; Street Culture.

I guess I just have a list of questions. What is the best app? Can buy into my own nft? If someone does pay for an nft of mine is the value stuck as a crypto base, or can I actually deposit the funds into an account?

"So honestly what excites me about the metaverse/web3 is the potential to form decentralized communities around common interests/goals. With the NFTs themselves serving as a tool/utilitiy layer to facilitate building of that community.  It seems like the marketing for every NFT project also plays on this aspect.       However for most projects ive looked into, you end up the joining the chat venue and most of the chat is two types of noise:   * Token price speculation  * Tech support questions from newbies trying to buy tokens to flip      Am i digging too shallow, or are there any NFT projects that have built genuine communities around a token. Communities that actually build/play/communicate together in the metaverse.       Ideally I would prefer a small close knit creator community, rather than projects engineered for while value.",0.9521,0.0,0.861,0.139

"The way I view a key benefit of NFTs for artists is that they disintermediate record labels and streaming platforms by: funding their work directly by fans by selling NFTs; with that kid of patronage, fans not are not merely being charitable but can actually derive value from that work themselves. However, I fail to see how that is possible if the fans do not get a fractional ownership of the work produced by the artist. Just printing your name on the blockchain on the artist's piece work is hardly tangible value to me; I surely will not be able to generate any cash flows from that asset.   Can anyone please critique my thinking above? I am having hard time grasping the true value of music NFTs if they do not carry with them fractional ownership of the underlying music rights.",0.9522,0.051,0.79,0.16

"As the title says, I thought it would be cool to sell an NFT with 60% of the proceeds going to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.

I know I wouldn't believe some rando on the internet that they will do something just because they say they will. However, I want to remain anonymous for privacy.

"I had a debate a few days ago with a friend who disagreed with my point of view, which is that the music industry and musicians profit greatly from the appearance of NFTs.     I explained to him that they may market their original content as NFT.   Selling music as an NFT is a new approach for artists and bands to monetize their work. It generates a one-of-a-kind token that grants the property's rights or a share to the owner. Furthermore, it provides fans a piece of the pie, making them even more invested in the success of their favorite bands.     What I found on the internet is that the number of musicians continues to expand as the music industry becomes more digitalized, and hundreds of new songs are released every day.      But, after speaking with him, I discovered that he is still unaware of the speed of technology and the crypto world, which is fine, not everyone is, and some of us require more time.    He believes that it degrades the music and causes it to lose its significance, I arrived to this conclusion because he did not have many good responses to my beliefs and perspectives, and he simply kept to the story that music would be meaningful.     I recommended that he go to Centaurify, a fantastic music NFT platform, and marketplace that works perfectly for me!     What are your thoughts on the subject?",0.9534,0.058,0.796,0.146

"Presentation of our NFT projet  Hello,  I will tell you the origin of the creation of our OpenSea page and I want to apologize in advance for my English. We have just added our first collection : [Falsified Reality](https://opensea.io/collection/falsifiedreality)   My sister has always been in a bubble since birth, with very limited social interactions. As a brother, I always supported her against anyone who could make fun of her as she was different. However, the most effective way she found to escape has always been drawing.  She has a very particular style, not pleasing everyone. I always told her that she was talented but how to prove it to her?  We recently saw a report on the NFT and the idea came together: to create a page by putting her drawings online in order to make them circulate around the world. Especially since I love the world of cryptocurrency I talk about a lot with her (she is getting bored aha).  She doesn’t want to do exhibitions in real life because she really thinks her style can’t please people. What do you think about that?  Why 5 copies of each drawing? We do not hide that the financial side also comes into play. Because of her phobia for social interactions, she lost her job a short time ago and it is very difficult for her to find a job now, even more with covid. (Btw i won’t make any money on my side on her work. I am just helping her)  Regarding the name 2-R-, these are simply the first two letters of our names.   Thank you for your comments!

"NOTE: Not affiliated with this project in any way, just posting something I found interesting and want to hear your thoughts and more importantly if this is sustainable (I’m looking to make money after all…)     Obviously we’ve seen the projects that give your NFTs a daily yield of some random ERC-20 token that has no liquidity and ends up dumping after a week’s time when people who’ve aped in eventually start to realize that these ERC-20 tokens are just being printed out every day and have no inherent value.     Yesterday however, I came across a project that brands itself as having sustainable passive income. For tokenomics, they have an emission schedule that ends after a year. After this period, the token they earn in essence becomes deflationary. The interesting part however is the fact that this coin gives you ownership over something they call the “Piggy Bank”, a DAO found which manages crypto and NFT investments. So your ownership of the token equals your ownership to this DAO fund. So of course doesn’t this give inherit value and even base value to the token itself as the fund keeps appreciating? They also explain how 50% of future collections will be injected into the piggy bank, and how all royalties will also go into it.     Curious to hear thoughts and what you think about the tokenomics/ staking mechanics.

"""Afrofuturism is a cultural movement that reimagines the history of the African diaspora through Sci-Fi and technology with a hopeful future in which the community thrives as technically advanced. It is expressed via a wide range of practices, such as art, cinema, literature, music, fashion, etc.  Imagine an alien race coming to earth, and telling the afro population that they felt empathy to the treatment they have faced for centuries, and decided to take them all out of earth and to another world where everybody was treated equally, where racism and discrimination never existed.  What might that world look like?  Many couldn't tell you, because both history and current times have only shown hardship. The imagination of the futurist is an amazing blueprint of a wish to finally depart from the history and memories that have been experienced and inherited, and to finally be a part of an equally inclusive world.""

"    I purchased my first NFT a couple of months ago for $350 (plus $80 in gas) after I saw an advertisement in a Metaverse platform I was exploring. After seeing the number of Twitter followers by this creator (\~20k) and seeing a couple of influencers that followed them, I (ignorantly) felt this was a great first NFT investment.  Little did I understand that two of the most important factors when investing in an NFT are:  1) community   2) their roadmap  After making my purchase, I learned that the Disc0rd community for this project was only 250 members and that of the 5000 NFTs planned to be minted, only 125 had actually done so over a 2-3 month period. When assessing their roadmap, I saw that their main perk was interacting in Metaverse developments that this creator had developed. However, the development in question is one that I believe won’t be around in 3-4 years from now.   Thus, I decided to cut my losses. Like any passionate collector, I did not want this NFT to affect the status and prestige of the rest of my collection. My NFT collection is an expression of my virtual brand and identity.   I decided to go on OpenSea and list this NFT for **less** than what I paid for it in order to increase the probability of liquidity. However, since this is my first sale on OpenSea, I was not aware that there was also an OpenSea account registration fee (\~$200) for your first transaction! With this plus gas for selling (\~$70), I will have spent close to $350 on fees alone! With the expected drop in price of my NFT by $50, I will have spent $400 and have nothing to show.  For $400, I could have flown to Medellin, Colombia from NYC ROUNDTRIP!  Although I had to pay all of these fees, I still decided to make this transaction because 1) I don’t like the project, 2) I need to pay the registration fee anyways, and 3) I would rather invest these proceeds elsewhere.   In conclusion, I want everyone to know that fees are inevitable when getting into the NFT space. However, if you choose the right projects, your profits will more than cover your gas costs when buying and selling.   I also want to give a big thanks to the team over at [Life in Meta](https://www.lifeinmeta.world) for helping me learn more about NFTs and the Metaverse.

"   I live in Argentina and my grandparents want to sell their house, the economic situation of the country is not very good so that everyone is constantly bidding to buy a house. Since the pandemic began, the situation in the country worsened and the working sector of our society was strongly affected. The value of our currency decreased in large percentages and the government established taxes to be able to exchange the currency for a stronger one which adds a great difficulty to be able to cope with the situation.  Many chose to sell their belongings and leave the country, which increased the number of homes for sale. So far sales of houses in cryptocurrencies were made to avoid taxes only and you can count on the fingers of your hands the number of times this was done.  My idea is what I raise in the title of this post. Register all the papers in a blockchain, make the registration legally according to how determined by the Argentine Government and carry out the exchange of the house and documents in physical and their documents also in an NFT format.  I would like to receive some tips so that I do not forget that I must register and also, that they share this in some way to find many more opinions, if you also have tips of where it is better to put this in an auction.  The price of the house is estimated at 265,000 USD, so that while this is not done they can make the account and equate the price in BTC.

"My question here is meant in good faith so please bear with me...  I was hoping someone could explain to me what you own when you own an NFT? Where does its value actually derive from?  Like, if you were to use a metaphor, what else is it like owning? If I own a house, I can live in it (i.e. it has use value) I can rent it out or sell it (exchange value). Same for most other things.  What I don't get is, an image is reproducible at near to zero cost. So, what do you actually own here?",0.9549,0.0,0.817,0.183

I genuinely feel like play to earn is going to be a completely different beast in a year or two. Companies like Square Enix are looking to incorporate it into their games. Companies like Citrus are incorporating tech like VR and AI into their games.   I feel like they are actually being taken seriously now and developers are beginning to put the game before the blockchain aspect. Long gone will be the days of hastily put together games with stock unity assets. Good things are coming and I'm personally very excited for the future.,0.9552,0.016,0.77,0.214

"The invention of NFT technology gave a powerful impetus to the development of virtual art and the implementation of the most daring, and sometimes even funny and unusual ideas. The result of one of these creative experiments can be seen today on the [OpenSee](https://opensea.io/collection/original-pixel-one) platform. The collection of colored pixels called ""[Original Pixel One](https://opensea.io/collection/original-pixel-one)"" received very contradictory assessments, indicating the uniqueness of these art objects.    https://preview.redd.it/pcug78jo11c81.png?width=1903&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=733999f499efec34c43a9218f7eb142f61a380bd  **Concept of the project**  The modern world, entangled in information networks, is increasingly disintegrating before the eyes of the viewer into small spare parts, colored spots, curious details, interesting baubles and other small fragments. Each of them is able to simultaneously maintain their individuality and be part of something bigger. Such a contradiction of the new reality was literally doomed to find its conceptual embodiment in the world of art. «[Original Pixel One](https://opensea.io/collection/original-pixel-one)» contains 256 color pixels of a 16-bit color system. It is they that we see, wandering our eyes around the sites, watching movies or funny pictures. The collection reveals the dimension of the smallest details and draws attention to the inconspicuous ""bricks"" from which the virtual world is built. Each pixel is tied to an NFT confirming the owner's right to the art object.    https://preview.redd.it/asqy5a8p11c81.png?width=1903&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf89ee5babda123c7dda86de989097bc2d3ffed8  **Project logic**  Owning an NFT does not mean that others cannot use this image \\video\\3D model, however, the society has somehow agreed among themselves that by owning an NFT, you become its sole holder. Logically, you also have rights to derivatives from your NFT. However, what if you own what all the other creations are made of, which are provided on all possible digital platforms? The Original Pixel One collection is the apogee of the madness and illogicality of the entire NFT culture, but this is what it is so interesting. How ""greedy"" can a person be who has the opportunity to buy and own a brick from everything that is around?  It is for this purpose that the ""[Original Pixel One](https://opensea.io/collection/original-pixel-one)"" collection was created, using it as an example, we will be able to observe where not only the NFT industry based on cryptocurrency is moving, but also human ""madness"" in general)  It is for this purpose that the ""Original Pixel One"" collection was created, using it as an example, we will be able to observe where not only the NFT industry based on cryptocurrency is moving, but also human ""madness"" in general)  Tell us what you think about the idea of selling 256 bricks that make up the entire graphics on the world wide web.

"Say hello to Stevie  Over a year ago, I was watching an interview with a gal about the effects of human trafficking, and what her and Her nonprofit we’re doing to combat it. They created a rehabilitation center for victims, women 11-21 years old, the only one like it in the USA. It left me feeling wanting to do something to help outside of donating money, something fulfilling. My wife’s therapy dog was laying next to me with her head on my chest, and the idea hit me like a bolt of lightning. We could train and donate a therapy dog. We wanted to do a litter of pups anyways, her offspring would be perfect for the job. A few months later we found a stud, and they got the job done. Purebred Australian shepherds, both with a loving temperament. So, I reached out to the CEO of said nonprofit, typed up what read like a job resume for a dog, and they said yes. The pups were born, we selected the best one for the job, and after 7 long months of training so far by me and my wife, in another two months Stevie here will be making the trip halfway across the country to live at this facility full time as a therapy dog for women who have been recovered and are rehabilitating from lives of abuse. He will live there full time as a comforting presence to these women, as well as going to court with some of them as they bear witness to their abusers judgements. Putting all this time and effort into Stevie is one thing, but I’d like to do more for them and him when we deliver him, namely, food. I’ve been kicking around the idea of trying to come up with as much food to send with him as possible so it’s one less thing they need to worry about down there. Now, my question for you. Would making and selling NFT’s of this one of a kind dog with an important mission in life be possible to raise money for food to send with him?  If so, can anyone direct me where to begin?

"It can be mainly divided into two points that we must first figure out what is virtual currency and what is metaverse.  What is virtual currency?  Virtual currency refers to non-real currency, which is not issued by monetary authorities, and does not have monetary attributes such as legal compensation and mandatory attributes. At the same time, it is not a currency in the true sense and does not have the same legal status as currency. Therefore, it cannot and should not be used as currency in the market. Incidentally, Citizens investing and trading virtual currencies are not protected by law.  what is the metaverse?  The metaverse is a virtual world that is linked and created by scientific and technological means, a virtual world that maps and interacts with the real world, and a digital living space with a new social system. The Metaverse is essentially a process of virtualizing and digitizing the real world, which requires a lot of transformations in content production, economic systems, user experience, and physical world content. However, the development of the Metaverse is gradual, supported by shared infrastructure, standards and protocols, and finally formed by the continuous integration and evolution of numerous tools and platforms. It provides an immersive experience based on extended reality technology, generated based on digital twin technology.  So why ban virtual currency but not metaverse?  Synthesizes the above two concepts, we can know that metaverse is supported by technology and is a research direction that combines virtuality and reality. Although both are blockchains, the unique properties of NFTs can create unique identities for everyone. The Metaverse is not a virtual currency, so don’t confuse it.

"...I find it interesting that there are some very clear empowerment projects in the NFT space. No, not ape power, not larvae, not at the yacht club. Things like World of Women exploding in value, basically great avatars. Then projects coming up like WomenRise with an even more clear genderpolitical agenda of empowerment.  It seems the user base for these projects are more ""solid"" than 10.000 gorillas or whatever, in terms of user base and user case?  Other empowerment-themed NFTs? I think these things are gonna increase in value slowly but surely, since they have a stronger community vibe.

The shapes and colours are selected using an algorithm, which is something that is typical for a machine, while the effect and beauty perceived is purely a human thing, so the final result is something that crosses both worlds.     What do you think about them? I have also some improvements in mind but for the moment I will start with this kind of image.

"An early and promising attempt at integration has come with blockchain gaming, with assets in play-to-earn games being NFTs that users can hold in their wallets to unlock features in their games. [NFTs bestowing ‘copyright’ is murky legal waters at best](https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/no-nfts-arent-copyrights/amp/). The integration of these assets over time with larger platforms is still, truly, at the behest of those larger platforms.    However, they are still in their infancy, and right now are more hype than reality.The idea of NFTs being used for sports ticketing is intriguing (remember, it’s just a key to whatever it needs to be a key to), and a huge boom in NFT sports collectibles have emerged around Barcelona, Porto, PSG, and other large clubs fan tokens. Messi even received part of his PSG contract in the club’s own NFTs.      So what of that current market?

However, NFTs have already broken away from their grandfather blockchain (and thus, it’s important to note, changing the blockchain authenticating them) for the same reason many other crypto sectors did — it’s just too slow and expensive.

"Everything these days is designed to be short-lived or disposable. Somehow everything is made for a short term or consumable. Even if you get the most expensive thing, it will break down within a year or two. NFTs and their digital nature came to mind, and I believe they have the ability to entirely eliminate planned obsolescence.     I really think that another advantage of NFT is that there is a possibility that even as much time passes, it gains in value. Especially if you actually buy it from a celebrity, a famous musician, or a designer, as is the case on the nOFTEN marketplace, where you can get only collections of celebrities.     Later you can trade that NFT and who knows how valuable will it be for a few years, so that's why I start practicing ""smart purchasing"". There is also that part that includes a bond between an artist and their fans, especially if you trade on these marketplaces as I mentioned above, where you can actually buy an NFT from your fav musician, for example, that's dope as well.

"Lately, they have been many reports of NFT rug pulls- both hard and soft. Obviously, this impedes further NFT adoption.  New users left with a sour experience might in a broad brush write off the space.     Most NFT projects mint all their NFTs right away. This means financial rewards for the team are front-loaded making a rug pull more likely.      One way to prevent these rug pulls is to adopt a sliding ""no questions asked, return"" policy. How would it work?     NFT minters are allowed to return their NFTs within a specified period of time to obtain a proportion of the mint price. This proportion would decrease over time     Suppose, you mint an NFT part of a new Baboons collection for 2 SOL. The team allows you to get a refund within 6 months; but every month that passes, your total refund amount will decrease 10%. Funds that need to be potentially refunded are stored in an escrow account governed by smart contracts. Every month, the non-refunded amount is released to the NFT team  With this policy, the team is held accountable. If it doesn't deliver on its roadmap, minters will simply request a refund and the team will receive a smaller amount of the mint revenue.  This approach benefits minters because their financial downside is capped. This would likely encourage them to make more bets on new projects.     Serious teams also get to credibly signal their long-term commitment by implementing this policy because their financial upside is dependent on satisfying minters.     Are there NFT projects which have implemented this? What's been their experience?      Adapted from [https://twitter.com/GirriHere/status/1490488380655816714](https://twitter.com/GirriHere/status/1490488380655816714)",0.9586,0.025,0.888,0.087

"HELLO YA'LL!   So I finished creating my first NFT Collection today, being all interested in the metaverse! It's been a while since I've been on Reddit and this will be my first post and my introduction into the Reddit family.   So this journey of creating this NFT Collectible came about sometime in the year 2019 when I was contemplating the impact of the slave trade and colonialism over certain countries and regions. Then created a piece of digital art by painting the river Thames in London, Uk red over a picture of the Tower Bridge in order to represent the amount of blood Britain's got on it's hands and called it 'Bloody Thames'.  After a couple of months of the NFT community growing more popular, I decided to hop on to create something through this platform. Hence after learning through a bunch of videos of my man  r/garyvee, r/hashlips, the 12 year old Benyamin Ahmed and many others to understand what the technology and the community was about I decided to dive deep into Bloody Thames and came across the Transatlantic Slave Trade and decided to document it through some form of expression or representation.

"I present you the only pièce de résistance you need to experience in your lifetime.    I know what I've created. I knew it had to be done many many years before the NFTs were a thing. The moment I woke up that morning I saw it. I saw the perfection of it. I didn't know why the universe is sending this to me and what I need to do with it, but I saved it. I kept the beast in the cage for a very long time. It was growing and growing and I was becoming weaker and weaker. I just unleashed it. I acted upon my urges. It's roaming around and it's waiting for his new master, but to only turn on him and make it his new prey. I was his prey many years ago and did not realize it. I kept asking myself why would the universe send me this demise. And now I understand. To only make me stronger.  I have very little knowledge about the NFT realm. It whispered to me that it wanted to reside there and it told me that this will save me. So I respected his wish.

"So before I mint my NFT's and put them on sale and then tell people ""hay come buy NFT's, it will work like donating to the homeless but also work as shares in a company""   Yeah gotta work on the explanation a bit also.  But basically the utility of the NFT im making is far more interesting and important than the graphic.   I will mint 270 EVER , sell each one for 1100k AUD..... this will allow us to start a physical company that not only houses the homeless but has so many connections with charitys that costs are cut to the point that at day 1 (after the first house is built) we start generating profit.   Around about 3k per month per house and we can build a new house  every 6 months (per house) .  And the more we earn the more our NFTholders (shareholders) earn.  So thats a quick rundown of what the plan is ,  the only idea i have for the graphic is a brick.  The idea being one brick is useless but many bricks make a house.   Is this too boring ?  Should I be hiring someone to do a graphic?  Or partner with someone in this area?  If so where do I start looking?   Thanks for the help all.",0.9595,0.042,0.83,0.128

The NFT gaming scene has developed so fast and the technology just keeps on getting better and better surprisingly fast.  I think at this point we just need more exposure especially considering how low the entry point has become compared to the old days of NFT gaming considering some projects like Dreem are helping people enter games like Axie Infinity at a much lower entry level.  Also the exposure of these gaming streamers will help NFT gaming gain more interest for developers. Currently there aren’t many projects focused on improving GameFi development this much except maybe for Citrus but thats it.  Overall it this move will help the GameFi and NFT gaming scene in more than one way and help us go mainstream faster.,0.9602,0.024,0.776,0.2

"Hello All, welcome to Xchanted! At its core Xchanted is a social app for NFTs. Past the social aspect, Xchanted will implement many other features that will make it a truly comprehensive and unique space for NFTs. We have been developing this idea for some time now and are excited to start producing the first versions of Xchanted. Stay tuned, we will continuously update you guys on new news and developments of the app. You can find these updates here and also on our Dscord, which will be linked below. Also, we want to integrate the community in the development of Xchanted. So, don't hesitate to reach out with ideas or suggestions. Maybe one day you'll see your idea come to life in Xchanted! Below you will find a more in depth explanation of Xchanted and an initial road map.  Xchanted is a social app for NFTs where people can come together to post, share, and show off their NFTs. It's a unique space for NFT artists, NFT collectors, and anyone who wants to be exposed to the NFT world in a new and interesting way. Xchanted allows for NFTs to truly thrive in a community based environment. Users will have access to a plethora of information about NFTs. They will see people's opinions and interact with conversations about NFTs. They will learn about new and upcoming drops. They will be able to form their own community among like-minded NFT enthusiasts and artists etc. Leveraging the unique social environment that Xchanted will create, users will also have the ability to buy, sell, and trade NFTs. The possibilities for NFT based social interactions are endless and ever evolving. Xchanted will be the go to place for all things NFT.   Initial Road Map:  January 25th Beta 1.0 - First Beta version of Xchanted will be live. This version will allow users to create their own profiles where they can display their art. Users will display their art through the collection page.  XDate Beta 1.1 - Beta 1.1 will include further customization of user’s profiles and will also include the “chants page”. The chants page will be a page accessible through a user's profile where people can see users' chants about certain topics or NFTs. Chants will be a separate page from users collection page. Chants will be a more text-centric page where people will be able to see the different thoughts and opinions of certain users. People will also be able to comment on and interact with the chants of users.  XDate Beta 1.2 - In Beta 1.2 users will have access to the lounge. The lounge will be the main social hub of Xchanted. This is where users will explore different pieces of art and all the conversations taking place on the app.  XDate Beta 1.3 - Beta 1.3 will introduce virtual galleries. Users will be able to implement virtual galleries into their profiles. Users can curate their own virtual galleries with their own art or art of others, and have exhibitions for users to come and explore the art in a 3D environment. Users will not only be able to interact with the art and others looking at the art, but they will also be able to buy pieces of art that they really like in the virtual galleries. The functions of buying and trading will be implemented later on after the app has found its initial ground and developed its social aspects first.",0.9603,0.004,0.943,0.053

"Hi everyone, I’ve been getting into nfts recently, and I’m just trying to understand the general demographic of people that buy nfts. From what I have learned so far, to me it looks like it’s made up of really rich people that buy nfts for art and status, etc. And people trying to make a profit, which is most people. Is there another group that I’m missing? I’m just trying to understand who I would be flipping my nfts to, just to understand better when to buy and sell. Like stepping inside their shoes. Are the people that I would be flipping to be other people trying to make a profit but not as educated on when to buy?

" Hi all, I was hoping to get the community's thoughts on something.   I design/build websites for a living, and right now, I have a client who wants to design an NFT marketplace. My job is to make sure that it feels trustworthy, safe, or for lack of a better term, ""not-scammy.""  Now, in some industries (like manufacturing, where most websites were built in the 90's and take 20 seconds to load), making the UI look professional is easy. You fix the glaring bugs, remove the 8000 WordPress plugins they've installed, and you already look like 90x better than your competitors.  But the blockchain world is run by people who, unsurprisingly, actually DO know a thing or two about the internet, so it's tougher to differentiate yourself. What's ""bad"" in the NFT world is still pretty high quality by other industries' standards.  So, what are some red flags for you? What says ""stay away""? And what says ""this is worth supporting""?",0.9607,0.01,0.841,0.149

"Hello!  My name is Nathan.  I am brand new to Reddit.  While I have always embraced technology and absolutely love it I cannot stand social media and have avoided it at all costs.  Why?  Well I’ve never been a people person and my life has consisted of mostly hermit-like hobbies including tabletop, home-brew D&amp;D, MUDs, basically being a geek before it was cool.  I got into trading cards over 30 years ago and have put together a very extensive collection of sets and singles over time and this new NFT tech makes me feel I can share the joy of these cards to other people without having to physically give it away.  So I am testing the water with putting up some of my more rare cards as an NFT for people to add to their digital collection. I am not sure about including the physical card with the NFT purchase. I’d like to start off with an extremely rare card from my favorite TV series, “Rick &amp; Morty”.

None of his work was ever published so he is unknown and I have the only know book of stories left.   I have often thought of having the stories published but never really looked into it. Recently I've thought about what the possibilities are of publishing as NFTs.   My thoughts thus far are to create limited numbers of each story as an NFT image, so basically a high resolution photograph exactly as it's written, there is beauty in the rawness. Possibly reducing quantities of each NFT until the last story has only one copy.    Has anything like this been done before?   Would there be any value in doing this?

As I gazed upon the outline of the biggest item he ever gifted to me I begin to formulate thankful responses to my generous kin. I tore through the wrapping paper like a merciless rabid animal. As I got closer and closer to the gold, my confusion multiplied. Once every shred of paper flesh was removed, the prank revealed itself. …NFT… My face :D to &gt;:( in seconds. I then recount the numerous efforts of trying to educate Matthew on the future potential of the crypto world and the all seeing lucrative NFT. I then remembered his mocking of each attempt.

I'm Murillo Alves, aka CryptoDex, I've been an artist for 10 years, I come from traditional languages ​​like painting on canvas (oil/acrylic/etc), murals on walls and I'm also a tattoo artist here in the real world.     I've been on the NFT circuit for about two months, I've noticed that most posts by artists are bombarded with useless comments from people wanting to win art, without even saying a ""congratulations"" to those who spent hours or even days creating certain art.    It makes me sad to see this, as most here are very talented artists who are looking for an opportunity to make a living from what they love, art.    I say this from my own experience, as an artist here in my country I have always been VERY undervalued, and in NFT I found an opportunity to really receive the value I deserve for my work...

The slight decline has me concerned, I won’t lie, but I have my full confidence resting on the fact that gaming NFTs will make a comeback that will flip the market on the heads of the doubtful.  Gaming NFTs might have slowed down in terms of profit making, but they have only risen in research and funding. That only means that new gaming NFTs are in the oven and when they are released they will turn some heads.   Someone else here mentioned to me the game Kitty Kart, played on Kitty Inu’s chain, and that’s one quick example that comes to mind. It seems like that can make it big.   How do you feel about gaming NFTs? Good idea or trend that has had its heyday?",0.9623,0.028,0.827,0.145

They have legal experts from top Bahamian law firms with an understanding of property law in the Bahamas and have invested in setting up a framework for investors to own their land legally, alongside a portal to manage said land. They will also have an NFT marketplace to buy/sell.  3/ By utilising NFTs many 'middle men' are cut out making this a more affordable way to purchase land. It also provides a more secure property rights than many are used to.  4/ There will a DAO and homeowners association where fair decisions can made around communal features of the land.  5/ You can visit, sublease and build on your land (subject to taxes) with amenities available and development grants for owners.  6/ Art by Bahamian artists which I'm really looking forward to seeing.   7/ Oh yeah, also its literally a plot of fucking land in the Bahamas.

"Recently Bitcrush Arcade has captured my attention with its hybrid BSC based gaming platform.   The hybrid approach allows for centralized gameplay while utilizing a non-custodial live wallet.  So when you add funds to the live wallet to play, those are still your funds. If the sever goes down, or  taken offline etc, you can claim your funds directly from the smart contract.  More security and playability  Definitely an ongoing evolution and a delicate back and forth dance between the super quick server and the slow blockchain. It’s pretty complex but it’s a great solution worth checking out and investing some time on it.  What do you think about hybrid gaming models such as this one?

Originally, I'd planned on figuring it out myself using Candy Machine, but alas I'm not a great coder. While I could certainly struggle through it, I'd rather start building a team of people who'd like to take this project farther than I could on my own.  I'm currently sitting on enough alpha assets to crank out all 7000 pups, but I'd like to mint in stages to *a)* add variety along the way and *b)* raise awareness along the way.  If anyone is interested in joining in, especially with the minting process, please don't hesitate. The door is wide open.   If you're curious, the website is samoyedicypups dot com.

"I am an indie author based in new york city. I recently self published an educational programming book that is also, in itself, is a full blown sci fi story. The book, called *The Nestomir*, follows a troubled adolescent from Wisconsin, named Jake Addison, who, after running away from school, encounters a crash-landed, coding-obsessed, alien warrior from a mysterious galaxy known as *The Nestomir*. In the book Jake learns many key programming lessons from the alien warrior.  I'm curious what people think about the potential of tapping into the blockchain/NFT community to market and grow the story readership...my gut tells me the NFT world is a natural fit because this community already embraces story telling—fantasy worlds, trading cards, collectibles, etc.  I hacked together an app for the book so I could use the software to enhance the story's learning experience (the app version contains the entire story)...so I think it makes sense to use the digital app to implement the story's NFT strategy. Also, I can give people redemption codes if they are interested in testing the functionality below.  # My NFT promotion idea  *Objective is to* ***reward early readers for their mastery of the story lore + lesson material****. And it goes without saying the NFT’s will grow in value if the series grows in popularity.*  My idea/How it works  * Embed disappearing “blue eggs” into the story text (app version) * If a reader sees an egg appear (I randomly tuned the nestomir app so \~20% of readers will see these eggs in certain places), the user can open the egg, and they gain access to a secret quiz url * If the user passes the quiz, their wallet is awarded an exclusive *Early Expert* Nestomir NFT.

"Hi,  So I see alot of auctions below floor price that are close to expiry. If I bid on it and win the auction am I guranteed to get the nft?  Can they decline my bid? I read that if it is over 1ETH it will go thru no matter what but if it's below 1ETH then the owner has to accept.   Is the reason for this because if an item is bid above 1ETH will automatically go thru because opensea pays the gas? Anything under the seller has to agree and then pay gas?   PLEASE help me understand how this works.  Also is there a way to know if the auction is ""sell to highest bidder"" or ""sell with declining price""? Also is there a way to see what the reserve price is?   Sorry I'm very confused please explain to me in the simplest terms thanks in advance guys!",0.9644,0.048,0.794,0.157
"I am making an NFT project where each holder will have better than 1:3 odds to win a prize.

"Hello world!  **This thread created to ask for your opinion, please, leave a comment, suggest functionality and participate in poll.**  We're team of developers who currently working on multithreaded OpenSea bidding bot.   At the moment, we see a big hole in the bot market - existing solutions are extremely slow and have poor functionality.  What we can offer?  \- Speed. Our multithreaded bot based on OpenSea API - it's unrivaled in terms of speed. You will be able to do 10 bids per second. Current bots that are sold on the Internet can do only 30 bids per minute.  \- Live floor price tracking. Bot makes bids based on floor price at the moment. How far below floor price do you want to go? Just put % value and bot will handle it all.  \- Outbid. You will be able to outbid opponents automatically - just setup your maximum bid in % based on current floor price.  \- Higher bids for Rare items. If item have Rare trait bot can automatically adjust bid amount based on that fact.  \- Auto sell option. Won item? Congrats! It's time to sell it ASAP and get the profit. Bot automatically list your item for sale at current floor price.  \- Reset all bids. If floor price for collection goes down too fast, bot have ability to reset all placed offers by auto swapping all WETH to ETH. This feature can save a lot of money at critical moment.  \- Web based application - you could use bot from any device.  **Profit:**  From our research, bot user can make **up to 10000$ per day** (highest what we found on Opensea, this guy flipping MAYC). Average bot user makes **from 1000$ per day**. PM me if you need proofs.  **Price:**  Currently you can find in internet only 1 option - bot for 4000$ that makes 30 bids per minute. Our bot will make 10 bids per second guaranteed, means it x20 times faster. **Price will be 10000$** per lifetime license and lifetime updates. Why so expensive? 1. API keys are hard to get and they are expensive - each license comes with 20 API keys 2. We don't want overload market with bots.

Hello everyone. I am new here and I have made an NFT collection on my years in a remote first nation and the beauty I witnessed there in nature and in the people. You can check out the collection at [https://opensea.io/collection/whereworldsmeet](https://opensea.io/collection/whereworldsmeet). Please let me know your feedback as this is my first attempt in the NFT world. I will be donating 50% of the proceeds to enhance the education in the reserve and I am really looking forward for everyone's feedback in the ways to improve and how I can improve the visibility of my collection.

"Friend and I got to talking about NFTs in games and he rolled his eyes. He asked me to explain to him in what way an NFT system like UbiSoft's or others on the pipeline are superior to things like the previously existing Diablo 3 auction house ; or the Team Fortress 2 crates and skins that can be sold on the market for money, or Counter Strike 2 skins and crates that also do the same.  Basically, he says he can't see where the ""value added"" claim about NFTs comes from. Can you guys help me explain to him why NFTs are superior to all the previously existing systems in games already?  Thank you.",0.9652,0.012,0.806,0.182

"My father passed away in 1987, but before that was a semi-professional artist.  He worked at an ad agency creating logos which are still in use today, but also produced many pieces of art.  These have not been shown in any capacity since about 1990 when it was in a few local art galleries.  I know it is *possible* to nft a high quality picture of the art and when listing the nft state that the physical art will remain with the family, potentially with the promise not to sell within my lifetime of 40ish years.  My question is, is this just a waste of time?  I'd like my father's art to get some exposure and my mother could use the financial support.  However I just cannot stomach destroying his art, and selling it....maybe some, but certainly not all.    Any thoughts are appreciated.",0.9652,0.024,0.823,0.153
"**Do you own research before investing:**  Per their site, PikaCrypto is the pioneers of GameFi (Gaming and Finances) by connecting NFTS &amp; blockchain gaming with the world. They became a registered business in Switzerland in 2021.  NFT Gaming has been a struggling business with high gas fees and many hands in the pot between blockchains. How will PikaCrypto overcome these obstacles?  Currently they have a single token ""PIKA"" and plan to release two more tokens to create a ""GameFi"" evolutionary three tiered ecosystem which is completely unique. Their primary blockchain is Ethereum, however they have bridges between several blockchains, using Polygon and rubic.exchange, allowing a person to invest using Bitcoin, Avalanche, Polygon (Matic), and other cryptocurrencies.  They released their NFT Marketplace called ""TheKraft"" back on December 13th, 2021. TheKraft is a collective artistic and gaming blend, showcasing the finest gaming NFTs alongside unique art created by our in-house art team and user created NFTs.   Their goal is to provide a no upfront gas fee while creating NFTs, only when an NFT is sold. A seller can then choose to sell or auction their NFT at a 2% list fee or $0 list fee if they sell using the ecosystem token. A buyer can also submit offers on an NFT without it needing to be put up for sale. A seller can review offers and choose to accept the offer.   To allow lower gas fees, they have the ability to sell in the ETH or Polygon blockchains. The marketplace is less than a month old, so we'll have to watch for new features as it matures.  With the noted features, NFT gaming partners can use TheKraft to support their NFT gaming system. Allowing PikaCrypto to support different styles of NFT gaming. PikaCrypto has partnered with others, such as Cyber Rogue, to host their gaming system. Each partnership allows buyers of the gaming NFTs to enhance the NFT potential and earn passive income and/or play to earn rewards. With a full-time support team, the limit has not been set and only time will tell if PikaCrypto will keep innovating ways to combat issues arising in the NFT Gaming community.  *Interested NFT Gaming business looking for a support system can list via* [*TheKraft.io*](https://thekraft.io/) *or visit* [*PikaCrypto.com*](https://pikacrypto.com/) *for support contacts.*  **Price Reference links:**  [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pika](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pika)  [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pika/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pika/)  [https://www.dextools.io/app/ether/pair-explorer/0xc31c590acfad809d3293f58a1873c182a9643b7e](https://www.dextools.io/app/ether/pair-explorer/0xc31c590acfad809d3293f58a1873c182a9643b7e)    https://preview.redd.it/xx56ax16bq581.jpg?width=702&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05ed835dbf27f81ec71bc5ae195cc4316c684fb1",0.9653,0.031,0.877,0.092

Something like VaynerNFT but what I would imagine to be a lot less expensive. I googled a lot, and perhaps there aren't a lot of firms or agencies doing this right now, or I wasn't searching the right thing, because nothing was coming up, so I figured you guys would know best.

What are some of utilities that stand out to you, and what do you think is a necessary utility for an NFT purchase?

"I am building an NFT project but want some input about the ""customer experience"" of the initial sale. I have fun ideas what to do with the blockchain but I come more from the dev side and still have to understand the community and subculture side of it.  In my case, some of the tokens will be inherently worth more than others (this will be a project more complex than just a regular NFT and will have a game element to it). I originally planned to sell or auction all the NFTs individually. So I would first sell the first block with an earlybird discount, then the rest of the tokens, but not all of them would have the same price. But at any time you know what you are getting and what you are paying for.  Now I see that many projects have something more akin to a raffle where you pay for minting a token and you get basically a random one. At least that's what the Solana Candy Machine does.   Is that more ""normal""? Is this considered more fair? I personally would rather know what I'm buying but I also understand that there can be fun in the ""gamble"" aspect where you hope to potentially get a highly valuable token for your $$$.",0.9659,0.025,0.864,0.112

"Now for something refreshing, today I came across a different NFT project that literally made me daydream. The possibility to own a plot on a paradise island!  I was envisioning something like this ever since I started looking into NFT's. The implications and disruption this technology can have regarding ownership of real-life assets.  After some DD, here is the project's overview 👇🏻    **About the project**  Blue Terra is the world’s first NFT tied to plots of physical land. The aim is to be the first IRL DAO backed by real world assets. Grow, explore and develop on a land that will forever be your own.  There will be 5,000 plots of IRL land of the Bahamas tethered to 5,000 NFTs on the Solana blockchain.     **Ownership of a Blue Terra NFT:**  Entitles you the right to visit, sublease and build on your plot of land. It also grants you access to the Blue Terra DAO and the right to contribute to the overall governance and direction of the project.    **What exactly you're getting?**  Each Blue Terra NFT will be tied to 1500-2000 square feet of land in The Bahamas with terrain that varies from grassland to beachfront.  To activate the lease embedded in the NFT, owners will go through a simple KYC process to validate their identity thus fulfilling Bahamian property rights requirements.    **Where will the land be?**  The team is currently looking at several properties in the Outer Islands for purchase and is in the process of surveying. Four that we are currently considering are Abaco, Crooked Island, San Salvador, and Andros. The land will be cleaned to let you build whatever you want on top of it: be it a house, cottage, hut, bar, restaurant, or even a tent &amp; hammock. Some plots will be beachfront and will therefore have a beach, sand, rocks, and all the other goodies that come with beach property. All plots will be within walking distance of a beach.   Regarding taxes, undeveloped land is not taxable. However, developed land is taxable. More details are available on the Official [Bahamian Ministry of Finance website.](https://www.bahamas.gov.bs/wps/portal/public/fina/MOF/!ut/p/b1/04_Sj9CPykssy0xPLMnMz0vMAfGjzOKNDdx9HR1NLHzdTf0tDDxDzUMCHE2NDNydDYAKIoEKDHAARwNC-sP1o1CVGJgZGoGU-DiFeVkaGgQbQRXgscLPIz83Vb8gN8Igy8RREQBrOsOo/dl4/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/)    **Legal concerns**  Blue Terra has a team of legal experts advising on retainer. Their legal talent features experience from top Bahamian law firms, such as Cotsfield, and Graham, Thompson &amp; Co. Blue Terra operates within existing Bahamian property law to ensure that the perpetual leases backing your NFT land ownership are adamantine.

"I admire how NFTs are attracting new customers and investors on a regular basis; it demonstrates that this market has enormous potential.  However, I believe that in the next years, only those with actual utility, such as the new Last Hopium, will be able to keep their own worth.  We will see a lot of NFT initiatives, which is excellent for competition, but only a handful will be able to maintain their market position. We'll know for sure when the time comes.  Let us not forget that this is the least stressful element of the bitcoin market, as one may hold the asset they 'love' without worrying about its market worth.

"Hi Redditworld.  Seeking assistance with a nft project. Absolute virgin at this so please forgive anything which I may write which is nonsense. Basically my situation is this- we are a band based in the Cayman Islands- we recently released an indie dance track which did well on local radio here and we got a lot of positive feedback. However, being in the Cayman Islands the reach of the radio is very limited and so we are looking to get the tune out to the big wide world via the magic of NFTs. To that end we are thinking of releasing the song as an nft with associated nft artwork. However, I want to be able to reward those people who buy the nft with rights to a proportion of the royalties generated by the song so that people are motivated to share it. Anybody out there who is much cleverer than me know how we would go about it? Cheers Jambo The Neverines",0.9665,0.027,0.813,0.16

"I've invested in a sports related NFT that has actual, IRL events and experiences, along with actual utility. For example, tomorrow for the super bowl I will be at a historic MLB stadium, ALL INCLUSIVE, before, during, and after the game because I own an NFT. Everyone was given a plus 1 as well. What I bought into was more than a collectible but instantly became my ticket to events, which is incredible to me. Without projects like this, I wouldn't be in the space. Have you found any NFT projects that provide some form of utility, more than just a collectible or the idea of a quick-flip? I would love to hear about them!

"Hey Everyone!  Our nonprofit is releasing its final set from our NFT collection tomorrow, Rhapsody 254, where **100% of proceeds go towards the purchase and shipment of educational materials for young students living in extreme poverty in Kenya.**  Inspired by music’s ability to draw light into the darkest of spaces, our nine piece collection offers an intimate view into the world of Ghetto Classics -- an arts education program focused on empowering Kenyan youth living in underserved, impoverished communities. The pieces in the collection, by Greek artist-photographer Achilleas Manolis, moments captured from our trip in 2019 to Korogocho -- an informal settlement in Nairobi which is home to some 400,000 urban poor. Korogocho is also the slum where the Ghetto Classics program originated and continues to serve approximately 1,000 children every week.  There is a growing need for additional support as more children wish to participate in the Ghetto Classics program. Participation in the program not only provides a safe place and community for education in the arts for these children, but acts as facilitator for community change in an otherwise forgotten slum.

The P2E game is coming out next month, with more and more uses on the horizon for the Alchecoin token. I grew up playing pokemon as surely many others here did, so I really feel a connection to alchemon and a predisposition to get into it because of that... This same nostalgic effect will happen to many other people when they find out about it too, so this project has real viral capabilty.  You also get paid rewards every week for simply holding your alchemon in your wallet. The rewards depend on how rare it is, (scroll down to see the breakdown here - https://alchemon.net/how-to-play.html). So not only is it a cool P2E game, the NFT's also pay a weekly royalty! that's legit. While browsing the sales history for each Alchemon I noticed Set 1 and Set 2 are rapidly increasing in value, Set 3 is slowly starting to pick up, Set 4 not appreaciating yet probably because it's still being distributed and the supply is so much greater.

"""I spend a healthy chunk of my time analyzing trends in the crypto space. Recently, I’ve been looking into crypto startups with great potential and this one really caught my eye. There are a lot of relatively new projects in teh space which have solid fundamentals like Aggregated Finance (AGFI). Such platforms make investing in Crypto much easier for ordinary folks who don’t have all the time in the world to keep up with this never-ending world of speculation.   Projects like AGFI provide Defi as a service by strategically investing in DaaS tokens on behalf of its holders and sharing with them the returns. The returns on the investments of the token holders are shared in form of buybacks and reflections. 10% of the reflections go to the holders while another 10% goes to more yield farms and other DaaS projects. I like the fact that such projects have transparent websites and relatively easy to maneuver even for first-timers. You are able to monitor your investments in real-time, without having to make any effort.  The project invests in Defi 3.0 tokens, which are the new wave in decentralized currency. To ensure the longevity of this project, 70% of the AGFI token supply is burnt on creation. This works to manage supply inflation. Each trade grows the community treasury, and the community controls how the treasury is spent.   I’m not the most successful trader in the space but I figured I might as well drop this here for people who are either new, out of the loop, or just lurking around. Unless you want to be in a rug pull like all the investors that put their quid on Squid coin, this is the safer and more guaranteed way to go. Helps you avoid shitcoins at all costs.

I’m curious how you overcome missing out on drops on sites like royal.io and sound.xyz.   From what I gather these used to work on a first-click-first-won type of process. But they now appear to operate on a sort of queuing type system… as in you try to purchase and it puts you on a sort of holding position to then assign you an NFT… if you’re lucky. Is this the case?   I’d love to learn more… how it’s possible to be more successful when it comes to securing and NFT in these lightening quick sellouts.,0.9678,0.015,0.784,0.201
I've been thinking about this for a while. Does anyone think that game companies will make their skins or special rewards like a video game gun or special piece of armor sellable to another user of their video game in the future? Feel like this is the direction NFT's are going. The video game company can take a small percentage of the transaction to make profit. I can see this being a great idea for mainstream games like Fortnite or call of duty for sure.,0.9678,0.025,0.716,0.259

"Me and a friend of mine are working on idea where we want to ship some merch along with QR codes. The basic premise here is that after the user scans the QR code we want them to be able to receive an unique NFT.   So my question to the devs/tech people Is it possible to make an implementation on a website where when an user clicks an unique link he gets a chance to add a minted NFT to his wallet? Gas prices payed and all, nothing needs to be done on the user side besides having a wallet. So basically gifting an NFT to their wallet after it has been connected.  The NFTs will not be randomly generated, so I asumme I dont really need to write a smart contract. Is that correct? From what I gathered so far, it would seeem to be the best way to use the OpenSeas API to somehow gift an already minted/listed NFT programtically?

"Hello,   I am an artist, a painter, of the old-school kind. I would like to start making my own NFTs but I have questions and I need your advice. I am in the possession of a masterpiece by a 20th century artist, along the lines of Mark Rothko and Cy Twombly. Unfortunately, I don't have the financial means to hold onto it and I don't want to call a gallery, sell it in the secondary market, nor use an auction house.  Bucking the traditional system for selling art could have its consequences but it's not a creative way to sell artwork. I'm familiar with the NFT marketplace and I'm skilled in Photoshop and Illustrator also. The way I see it I have two options for selling physical artwork as a NFT.   1) Imbed the NFT into the picture frame and sell it as a physical artwork.   2) Create a unique NFT based on the painting. Sell the NFT with the painting as a token included in the sale.   If there are other options, please let me know. Which of these two methods are more preferable and why? Also, I was going to use OpenSea but if there is another marketplace that is more appropriate for this project, please let me know.   This is a new adventure for me. I need your help!

"Hey Everyone,  We recently started an NFT project for our indie film studio DBS Films.  We've currently made 9 feature films with our 10th in post production now and we aim to make at least 2-3 a year from now on.  The idea behind this project is giving you a 1:1 of the cover art for each film.  100% of the royalties go to fund the movies with the idea that the more they grow the better movies we can create because of them.  Then because of the success of the new movies the value of the original cover arts will increase, imagine getting one of George Lucas's early works before Star Wars.   Obviously that's the slim case but we have been having more and more success with disruption and now have a agent for our latest film  We have about 75k followers on our social media and are going to create way more BTS and podcast material this year.

According to David Gibson's Twitter, senior analyst at MST Financial, he asked what the Japanese gaming giant thought about the metaverse and NFTs, and was confirmed that they are not currently working on anything, but are still defining what they could offer to players.

"Good morning guys,   As we know that the good part of the  income of artist either comes from streaming or concerts, if i talk about concerts it is difficult in current situation and if i talk about streaming, fans listen to their music and appreciate their work but earning from streaming is very very low and it’s not enough to survive for artist.  How pianity can be revolutionary?   Basically Pianity is music nft platform where artist can sell their music in the form of NFT and the artist also get royalty when fan/buyer resell it. In short Artist earn more then any streaming platform.  I think there is huge potential in this music NFT industry and Pianity is one of the best music nft marketplace.  Any Idea or suggestion? Yes! On the base of the report on CNBC, there are 12% of people who get scammed during, buying concert tickets.  so with the help of  NFT's Tickets a person can verify the ownership of a ticket. Which can be helpful so Pianity should consider it.",0.9686,0.027,0.835,0.138
"Right off the bat: I have no idea what I'm doing. I love to draw and create stuff and thought NFTs might be a way to share what I do. It's inspired me to start playing with animation which has been a blast, so that alone makes it worthwhile, even if I never sell one.   I wanted to learn more about what NFTs are and where they were going, and since I tend to learn best by just doing, I put this collection together.  Any feedback y'all can give is appreciated.

"Are gaming NFTs still going on? I played some Axie infinity a while back with some friends but I have not checked back with it since. So what's the scene like with gaming NFTs? I kept hearing about bigger and bigger projects and suddenly there's a lack of recent news on the subject.   Someone here brought up Kitty Inu and their P2E game kitty kart, though I haven't checked it out yes. The concept seems interesting however, a karting game with NFTs. Sounds like something I'd buy into and play for hours a day.   I have been making the rounds, scrolling Twitter and checking Reddit though not much news on the matter. I think gaming NFTs are a massive feature endeavor not to be overlooked and this subject needs to be given more direct attention I believe.

" Introducing CARGYZ, a lighthearted celebration of the people that make the auto industry possible, uniquely portrayed in non-fungible tokens (NFT's). Everyday, millions of people around the world get up and go to work making our transportation needs possible. Little thought goes into the countless workers needed to make the auto industry function. The events of the last couple of years have really shown the true value of these tireless champions of the chariot.    It takes many hands to make our dream car possible, CARGYZ highlights the people that make it all possible. Rather then start at the beginning of the process, the first series starts at the end, the Dealership. Our 10,000 piece Series 1 collection will highlight the last link in a long chain of heroes. Most folks would not refer to car salespeople as heroes, in fact they would be more likely to use the opposite term, villain. Having spent over 25 years in the car business, I can tell you without hesitation there are many heroes amongst them. Unlike most jobs that allowed you to stay home during the pandemic and work, there’s no way to take a customer around the lot from your living room. No way to test drive from your home office. And no way to touch, feel and smell that new car from the kitchen table. You had to be there, right in the middle of all of it, with only your disposable mask for protection.

Thanks in advance!   1. Is it smart to release a single on NFT?  2. How would that work in playing it live and putting it on an album?  3. Can a single be minted 5-10 times for 5-10 people to be able to buy or should it be only 1?  4. If I release the single on YT, Spotify, Apple Music, should the NFT have extra perks that you can’t get on other platforms? If so what type of stuff tix for a concert, merch etc or something else?  5. Would an mp3 be enough to make someone buy or does adding art and video increase the value and uniqueness? Would it be a different video than the one released on social media so that its truly one of a kind?",0.969,0.0,0.867,0.133

"Real estate NFTs work just like any other NFT. They're purchased using a cryptocurrency of the seller's choosing, held in a [digital wallet](https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/personal-finance/articles/digital-wallets-are-now-the-most-popular-payment-method-in-the-world/), and, if speculative, are sold again for a profit to a buyer with the right amount of money.  Investments held as FO tokens behave more like stocks in that they represent a share of a real estate project rather than a single real or virtual item. Profits are paid like any other kind of share-based investment since ownership is just a share of a business. For example, if you had one of 10 tokens of a real estate company that invests in apartment buildings, you'd be sent a check at the end of an earnings cycle that represents 10% of the net profit (unless you had a different agreement in place).",0.969,0.0,0.816,0.184

It’s pretty simple honestly, those who have a bad roadmap or too hopeful on crowd support might not be the best option. Those that are carbon copies off major tokens probably won’t sail. Those that are built by massive companies might not be the best idea.   Look for the projects that carry hope within reason. The ones that offer innovation and creativity.

I live in a Kharkiv all my life - 24 years. It’s an amazing place with beautiful parks, rivers, people, nature and architect. Most of that were destroyed, gone in a fire because of a russian aggression (war). Our army are fighting, volunteers helping, regular mans filled the territorial defense groups. It’s all shows how brave and courage our people and nation.  I really wanna defend my country in the ranks of army but I have some troubles with my hurt and have mentally unstable mom and grandparents which I need to care. We are living in a basement with some old people and some kids. It’s a little bit cold here.  I try to help this people, I’m ordering humanitarian aid, buying some food and asking volunteers for theirs help. I do whatever I can to help people around me.  When I were listening some music after first week of an explosions and psychological shock I understood a new reality that I need to accept and live in. That’s why I decided to sell some NFTs. From the beginning it was a horrible problem because I don’t have a laptop and can’t paint well. I remembered that I have photographs of my beautiful city. I made some round borders and added flag of Ukraine with a name of a city. In my dreams if I will successfully sell all my 10 photos for 200$ each it’s gonna be 2000$. From that amount of money I’m gonna buy cheapest laptop for study and work (that’s my dream). From remaining money I’m gonna buy food supplies for people in my basement, gonna support army and animal shelter.

"For almost a decade, the digital world has played an important part in our lives. Blockchain and NFT technology brought the world to a completely new manner of appraising and collecting art. While others remain unconvinced, prominent industry participants such as historic auction houses are adapting their curatorial and commercial operations to meet the demand.     I recently learned about Streeth, a new Blockchain NFT firm that is transforming street art as we know it. It's providing NFTs a real, physical use case, and it reminded me of what a SK8coin represents, they represent skateboarding, artists, and street art/ culture through NFTs as well as Streeth. So I'm glad to see that there are more and more NFT communities like these two.     Prior to Streeth, most street art was primarily restricted to the streets: along building walls, beneath bridges,etc.  Streeth, on the other hand, was determined to change that. For the first time, Streeth is making street art accessible for purchase as an NFT on the Ethereum network. In other words, a digital version of the artwork is now available for purchase exclusively through Streeth's painstaking curating, minting, and auctioning procedure.

" So, I've been working on an NFT collection which is completely crowdsourced. Similar to r/place in that each person gets to pick what 1 pixel looks like. Given all the art and dedication that got put into r/place, I was thinking there should be an NFT equivalent to it (without literally piggybacking off of place itself). My issue at the moment is such a thing obviously requires contributors. I had about 20 friends contribute a lot of pixels in 10x10 chunks over a couple months, but I still needed to build out a fair bit with code and even manually. I'm guessing a lot of other artists in here have had issues with community building in the past, and if you had any advice to share, that would be great!

"DayNFT was born after remarking a series of common pitfalls (to our eyes) of common NFT projects:  \- They have a hard time guaranteeing rarity, as they often mint thousands of copies of the same image and may create new collections at any time, constantly diluting holders' value.  \- They are covered by an enormously confusing marketing shield, made of endless announcements, private/alpha/beta sales, airdrops, lists of various colours, pre-mints, pre-pre-mints, gifts, you name it!  \- They rarely provide any real value, apart from promising even more future additional airdrops.  DayNFT is an attempt to do things differently, in particular:  \- Rarity and scarcity are guaranteed by only minting a single NFT per day (a rule that is hard-coded in the smart contract). It is assigned to the highest bidder in the daily auction. Users also add a text to their bid, which is shown in the minted NFT and acts as a sort of message to the future, provably coming from a given date.  \- No marketing shield. The auctions in the dapp are and will always be the only way to mint a DayNFT.  \- Holders are entitled (by contract) to 50% of all future proceeds of the project, becoming actual shareholders of the project!  As a bonus point, DayNFTs live on the Flow blockchain, which means almost zero gas fees and minimal environmental impact.   I'd love to hear your feedback about that.

"Hey,   I was curious what cryptocurrency projects you guys can recommend that leverage NFT Marketplaces/Metaverse ecosystem plans as utility, versus the other way around which we tend to see more commonly in the NFT landscape?     For example, NFTs that allow stakability and yield a utility token, whereas I'm curious about tokens that exist prior to the NFTs genesis?

"Hey, I'm excited to attempt to sell my first nft on Opensea. The process has been relatively straightforward however I'm seeing the gas fee is higher than I expected. Not to overstate it but I am confident in my work but haven't had any experience selling an NFT.  I used to have a fairly small but engaged social media following for my work that emerged pretty naturally so have some precedent of positive response online.  Say I list this work on Opensea, without me using some online following from elsewhere like instagram, will it just naturally sink to the bottom on Opensea barring work that is Beeple level? I was thinking of listing an auction starting at basically the current gas price, but then if it doesn't sell in the 7 days I've just burnt cash for no reason and assume it will charge me the gas fee again if I try to auction it another time, correct?  I'm just wondering if there is a real entry point for me into NFTs at this point, as I'm willing to take some risk but don't know how good the Opensea marketplace is at getting eyes on your work (can I sell my work by its own merit?). I might just take a step back and keep building my work independently of this.

Please correct me if I’m wrong, but aren’t NFTs and crypto supposed to be real assets and have actual value at the time you purchase them???   I’ve found one project which embeds their own token onto their own token known as the (3,3) NFT 3,3 = staking  Since the embedded tokens guarantees the minimum value (i.e. floor price of the issued NFT) isn’t this a plus?  This ensures that the nft holder will have the minimum value guaranteed by their own tokens on top of profits…  If the embedded token is already staked, it protects the risk of the token also being released into the market.

This can only mean that the majority of investors rely on Reddit for serious crypto recommendations and for the rest of social media (Twitter, TikTok and YouTube…) for just quick ideas. Notice how mentions peak slightly before price peaks as well, it could only mean heavy Reddit mentions are affective value.  It seems Redditors hold a large responsibility entrusted upon them to carry the market, and it’s something hard to carry yet they’ve done their work tirelessly.   From a personal perspective, I know I’ve seen recommendations on Reddit many, many weeks before they make it out there. Whether that may be with the Apes, punks or with the new Royal Falcons Club, I know that what is said here is meticulously audited by the mods so that there’s no lies going out there that will harm people, especially those with shallow pockets.  Personally, I trust and value Reddit for serious market talks, and it seems the rest of the market does so as well.",0.971,0.066,0.805,0.129

"I have started a series of NFT collections on OpenSea under the name of ""Night's Frightful Terrors"".  In particular I would like to announce my first collection ""NFT - Fullmoon""!  I would like to say a missive thankyou to everybody here on reddit for all the insight and knowledge to settings one of these up. As a massive thank you, I am having a HUGE discount on 100 of the collectables, anybody who purchases one of these particular collectables will also get a receive another random collectable from another 100 collectables I am setting aside. As a part of the thankyou this deal will only be advertised on reddit for 72 hours or until they are sold, more info below.  Fullmoon is the first race I introduce in my serious and consists of the Werewolves. The collection will contain 10,000 collectables ranging in rarity (pack rank) and there will also be 5 legendary wolves.  Each werewolf will have it's rank in the pack, either the Alpha, Beta, Delta or Omega. Each pack will consist of 20 wolves and also have their own unique Sigel.  The collection tag in OpenSea is NFT-Fullmoon, even if you're not interested in purchasing any of the collection please show your love and favourite your best wolves  DISCOUNT  As a part of the discount I will be massively lowering the price of 5 packs (500 wolves) from Werewolf #501 to Werewolf #600. Anybody who purchases one of these 100 wolves will then receive a random werewolf from Werewolf #601 to Werewolf #700...  Also those interested this is the perfect time to bag a full pack as there are 5 up for grabs, I imagine once I get this collection off the ground this could be where the real value is.

"I have been using cryptocurrencies for many years and I know the mechanics ... I know what an ERC-721 token and an ERC-20 token are and the differences, and everything in between ... but I can't conceive of some of the mechanisms of NFTs. Hope someone can help me understand. Then. First of all, if I create an NFT (which would simply be a token with a supply of 1, right? And that has the URL where the NFT file resides, right?) Since I am creating it, i'm also minting right? So why in nft projects is it who buys to mint it? This is the first thing that I can't quite understand ... The other thing is: if an NFT is a single token, how come in many projects more people have the same NFT? And then .. if I created an ERC-20 token and set the quantity to 1, wouldn't it have the same characteristics as an ECRC-721 ?? What I am thinking (which is perhaps wrong) is that a collection that contains multiple nft is simply an erc-20 contract of which each token is unique? please help me understand :( Thanks and for any answers ...",0.9713,0.019,0.853,0.128

"Hello community!  I've recently created this new NFT collection called ""Vive la Vie"".  In English, it means ""Here's to life"" and the collection consists of 10 unique photographs that capture different moments of life in nature and in history.  As well, there are secret photographs that are only unlocked if you happen to buy one (all of the secret photos are unique from one another).    The reason why I wanted to create this collection was because I wanted to express life in quite different ways and I found that photographs were a perfect medium for that.  As well, I wanted people who are active on NFTs to see a different sort of NFT apart from the typical things.  The price for each photograph is 0.05ETH, but offers are always welcome!

My thoughts are to get people who are interested in the project on a WL and set a date for when the project will be available for them to mint, but I'm concerned about getting ripped off before release. How do you promote your project without getting ripped off? Should I setup an LLC and get register a copyright? How does one even go about doing something like that for an NFT collection?

" Well I am not talking about any random moon NFT project, but it's a project with a vision. Authors are now happy to publish their books at just 1% or less in the NFTBOOKS \[NFTBS\] project and can keep the rest of the 99% royalty to themselves. Authors are now no longer required to pay 30% of their income to Amazon. And hence more and more growth for authors and platforms simultaneously.     I am happy that I found my Gem Project which has utility and can benefit many authors in growing their business. ",0.9722,0.04,0.716,0.243

"Aside from the keyword 'Metaverse', the global search for 'NFT' also appears to have declined since the beginning of this year. However, the decline for NFT is more noticeable as it reached record highs in 2021 and then plummeted in the first quarter of 2022. Both search terms appear to have taken a nosedive since the start of 2022.     Search interest in both terms appears to be significantly less than in the last quarter of 2021. Last December, NFT managed to surpass the search term Crypto. Meanwhile, the search term Crypto has conquered this place again. Apart from this, the NFT marketplace OpenSea hit a new all-time high with monthly trading volume being higher than ever in January. The increase in keyword search volume and trading volume shows that NFTs have caught the attention of the mainstream. Much of this growth in the NFT world has been attributed to the various celebrities who have promoted the new technology in the form of their own NFT collection. From influential rappers like Snoop Dogg to marketing experts like Gary Vaynerchuk; many figures sparked interest in NFTs last year. It is not yet known whether the downward trend will continue or not.  Right now im researching a project called Fusang. Fusang Is Already Way Ahead of the Competition. Fusang exchange is a fully-licensed player in the traditional and digital exchange spaces. Its offerings cater to companies looking into primary and secondary market offerings and cater to the end user interested in investing for future returns. At its base, Fusang is a one-stop shop for all equity market player",0.9723,0.0,0.905,0.095

Crypto games are fun and make a lot of profit. And I mean a lot of profit. If you’re an Axie manager running a little team you’re making a real profit doing nothing. The scholars working beneath you are also profiting through the trickle.   More modern games like Kitty Kart provide the user with more profit and take the managerial role out of the equation.

"Hello all,  I wanted to introduce this project that I have recently taken part in as a community member. **Made By Humans** is a digital artistic and community-based project containing three NFT collections, all living on the **Solana blockchain**. The three collections (the first collection is **Humans In Hell**) revolve around Human's journey throughout, hell, Earth, and to heaven where they'll be rewarded! There will be a total of **3333 Humans in Hell with 50+ attributes** willing to survive and get their second chance on earth. The lore, art, roadmap, and utilities tied along with the project and its capability to collaborate with other projects exemplify its uniqueness.  The best part is that our community is in its early phases with only 294 members, the creators of the project take active roles within our community, keep us updated on their progress, and have many WL spots and roles available. The heads of the project are also preparing for an AMA for questions you may have. Hope to see new members coming into our family and help us hit our first milestone of 333 members!

" So, how do NFT games work? The simple answer is that NFT games allow users to earn money as they play. Blending video games with finance, or GameFi as players call it, these games use NFTs -- unique digital collectibles on the blockchain -- that gamers can sell in games to other collectors and players. Gamers can also earn NFTs in certain pay-to-earn gaming models. This setup allows gamers to invest in NFTs, which have the potential to appreciate.    Several NFT games have emerged as popular platforms among gamers as a way to earn and buy NFTs to make a profit. Some NFT games you should keep an eye out for are: Alien Worlds, Arc8, Axie Infinity, CoinFantasy, Splinterlands. These are just a few of the many games you can earn big bucks from.NFT games are one-way investors are cashing in on the NFT craze. Many NFT games incorporate financial models, allowing players to make money as they play. As NFT gaming popularity increases, the economic potential could rise. In conclusion, you can earn a lot of money from these NFT games, so you should already be doing that. You can also have a lot of fun playing them as well!",0.9726,0.007,0.862,0.13

Owners of a Founders Access Pass will also be able to mint a one-of-a-kind, tradable visor design that will be randomly created and have varying, supposedly random levels of rarity. NFTs used as a early access pass is a nice idea, and represents one of the uses NFTs could have, which is the reason us NFT investors keep minting NFTs like Parrotly Finance NFT, Invisible Friends and Pixelmon. The Founders Access Pass will only be available to a limited group of 10,000 community members who will be able to purchase one for $50.

"Hi everyone im looking for advice on creating a whole new crypto currency ive got a massive white paper im writing. What im wondering is should i do an nft release to generate funds to develop the new crypto or is there a way i could crowd source it? Without giving to much away before im ready, It will be decentralised and driven using nfts that have actual physical value in real life not just digital. Its a crypto that will be backed like traditional money with actual real world value except that its real world value will be far more valuable than a gold backed currency. Im fairly new to crypto but ive been trying to create this for 10 years and now ive discovered crypto and blockchain the technology is finally at a point where it could work. The core reason for me wanting to do this is because im disabled and using metaverse and other new tech i can see a way to include disabled people in more things and give both disabled and people from underprivileged countrys the same opportunities as every one else. This is just one tiny possibility in my plan and so many more benefits. Appriciate any input from anyone. A bit about me, i am a mechanical engineer but i have a rare disease that is slowly putting me in a wheel chair, i specialised in 3d modelling.

"I just realised a use case for NFTs that would change the world. I think Nike is already onto it, but theres so many applications.  What if companies released NFTs that were redeemable for future products.  Ie: What if Tesla releases a $60,000 NFT that is redeemable for a new model of Tesla car to be released in 2023.  The advantage for Tesla is obvious. Get a massive cash injection today for a product they haven't even developed yet, let alone sold... And they pay no Interest in loans etc.  The advantage for early buyers is obvious because the item is fully tradable and exchangable. If they only released 5000 of these, the price would skyrocket as wealthy people would climb over each other to secure the car and ensure stock was kept aside for them.  People could also make money flipping it, trading it.  Better still the value of the token would change based on the expected features etc. So it would be a kind of futures market for physical goods that anyone could get involved in.  It would completely revolutionise things like Kickstarter.",0.9734,0.034,0.82,0.146

"Hello, I have been reading up on NFT's lately but fail to find an answer to this question.  Is it possible to update the visuals of an NFT once it was bought. What I mean by that is following.  Img1.png is displayed in the shop, when someone buys it, they recieve a link through ""unlockable content"" which, once pressed, replaces the Img1.png with Img2.png in the shop. So now everyone can see at a first glance that this NFT has been ""opened"".  If yes, is it possible to extend that, so that every time an NFT changes hands, it ""evolves visually"", making it visible at first glance, how many times this NFT has been sold.   If yes, are there some special conditions to fulfill when creating such NFT, such as using a specific blockchain or having some sort of algorithm in the background which listens for the link to be clicked to perform the action?  I managed to find some posts saying that the metadata can be changed after minting, but I'm not sure if the same principle applies to the visual appearance as well.   Any help is greatly appreciated!",0.9737,0.034,0.82,0.146

"We deployed an NFT viewer, where you can see all your NFTs including the ability to see any resources that are attached to the NFT, like GLB files etc.   This was our main inspiration actually as one of our NFTs contained multiple formats which were not easily viewable on other platforms. So we created the viewer, but then it made sense for folks to just look up any NFT they wanted not just ours. (Contracts can also be looked up.)  Anyhoot, there are a few issues right now like loading time may be slow on some assets, especially those that do not have many IPFS nodes hosting the content.   We are adding a sorting function in the next update and looking at adding some caching to help with slow loads.

They have the most impressive art and video content that I have seen from an NFT drop. I personally identify with their art/avatars. Their team is made up of successful entrepreneurs, artists, and developers from around the world and their work is well known on social media. They are creating a mobile app called ""Meta Connect"" where I will be able to socialize with other Meta Legends throughout the world. With this app, they also have a map feature where you can see which cities that other Meta Legends are located. They are working on partnerships with other large NFT drops (such as CyberKongs) to get their community on the app as well. They are building out a Metaverse platform called ""Meta Life"" that aims to be on the same level as DC or Marvel. Their community is made up of \~200,000 members and I love their story.

"My point about NFTs is at the end.  The piece below appears to show watermelon seeds and candle wax used to write the word Ripe on an old office folder. Painted by Ed Ruscha - this truly stunning work of art recently sold for $22,200,000.   https://preview.redd.it/wyvlnb024pp81.png?width=780&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=101bcc760e28b324809ab840862e5d74012a2b24  Here’s another masterpiece, the “Onement VI” - better known as “Blue”. Barnett Newman is the genius behind this piece. In an interview Barnett said he was inspired by the ping-pong table at his old high school. It sold for $43.8 million.   https://preview.redd.it/8varnkh44pp81.png?width=598&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94d7a0affaacddb5048bee4e84c622d8f3d9a698  This next work of art comes from a true once-in-a-century genius, Mark Rothko, known for his rectangles. It is said that he got the inspiration for his paintings by staring at the paint swatches his wife brought home from Sherwin Williams. It sold for $72.8 million.     https://preview.redd.it/4wq78w864pp81.png?width=641&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cac16b6343d5de88da2eb388f1f766ea66920705   Now, if you are a huge fan of rectangles but can’t shell out enough cash for three of them (and a black line to boot), you can purchase the two rectangles below for the bargain basement price of around $9 million.     https://preview.redd.it/7f0w4h884pp81.png?width=567&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0769a5c4a9e09f694a30e83f4e70c34e8e98a65f     You can also go to Home Depot and have paint swatches blown up with poor resolution.  Paintings aren’t alone in drawing enormous sums. Below is a 3-foot-tall stainless steel bunny. It sold for $91 million at a Christie’s auction. It was made by a guy named Jeff Koons - who is still alive.    https://preview.redd.it/r2g3fnga4pp81.png?width=738&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35e5a6842d2b724873d2b832e660ab4555706ac2   If you are drinking anything put it down so you don’t spit it out on your phone or keyboard when you read the ridiculous description found in Christie’s essay describing the bunny:  *It is crisp and cool in its appearance, yet taps into the visual language of childhood, of all that is pure and innocent. Its lack of facial features renders it wholly inscrutable, but the forms themselves evoke fun and frivolity, an effect heightened by the crimps and dimples that have been translated into the stainless steel from which it has been made…The steel surface of the titular bunny initially appears smooth and balloon-like, the forms reduced to some abstract, Platonic ideal.*  Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha — what now?  Now here's an NFT that sold at a Southeby's auction in June of last year for $11.8M (Cryptopunk).    https://preview.redd.it/mnwxuxuk4pp81.png?width=1015&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6253b7f741a39ba30acef0f9b8c6dd13655d0ab  Just for fun, let me try playing the role of Christie’s acid-dropping art school intern responsible for the bunny description…  *This punk is modern yet retro in its appearance. Dating all the way back to 2017, the pixelated N-95 mask taps prophetically into the visual language of modern healthcare. Using only 576 pixels, the creator has masterfully ensured that not a one is waisted - a single pixel being transformed into a golden earring is the height of minimalistic design. The light sapphire-hued skin-tone anthropomorphizes the alien nature in all of us, and the beanie manifests as a potent reminder that even in a cold world - humans can find warmth.*  Are $70 million rectangles and $90 million bunnies that different from a $12 million JPEG?

So I understand there is a fee(gas charge?) For posting a piece of artwork as a NFT. I work with 3D software alot. But the startup cost seems to be kind of insane (also not familiar with why they cost so much to begin with) . I guess my main question is what's the best way to go about getting my artwork as a NFT ? Is it just about having crazy funds or is it more about finding the right marketplace / community to list it?   Would it be better to just outsource my art to people who can afford to list them or just save the funds to do it myself?  I am not looking to post my art for ridiculous amounts like I keep seeing.

"Hey r/NFT ,  I am a 15 year software engineer and with the birth of NFTs had a thought. Similar to an artist creating a unique piece of art and minting it as a purchaseable NFT, I was wondering if the same could be done with code.  For example, would it be possible for me to create a unique app or game that I could sell to a single person as a solo participant activity (i.e. only the buyer would be able to use/plat it)? Each app/game providing a unique experience to the owner?  My google-fu has only sent me down a rabbit hole of apps that help you create or mint NFTs, and games that reward players with NFTs.

"There aren’t many high quality NFT games with good graphics and entertaining story. For some reason devs are making copies upon copies of NFT games.  Aside from a couple popular games like Sandbox and up and coming ones like Legends of Elumia, there aren’t many to consider high quality.  The ones I mentioned seem to focus more on the player’s experience while still maintaining high profits.  Others seem to focus solely on profit and completely ignore the entertainment factor (which is the most important part of a game).

"Let’s start with what it is I have found.  “Tezos Thugs”  https://twitter.com/TezosThugs  This is a project that one might shrug off at first glance and continue looking at others.. as the art is pixelated and not the most pleasing when first quickly looked at. After the project had a good blowup I began looking deeper into the art. Let me just say the more I looked, the more every piece started to become very appealing to me. After finding out every piece of art is hand drawn with exclusive 1 of 1 rights to use that skin in his game unlike the vast majority out in the NFT space doing generative projects, I began to be more intrigued. This makes every single piece completely unique and more valuable as even the slightest subtle changes can make one piece more rare, especially in the early stages of the art timeline.  Through digging into the project more and acquiring a interview with the owner “ThugZoot” I was able to obtain a better understanding of what this project is set to be and what made it worth buying into. I was very skeptical as you should be with any project in the NFT space. During my interview I found ThugZoot does this full time leaving behind any jobs which at the time was super risky. He wants to help the community, develop a game, create a clothing line and allow people to make investments getting certain rights and receive promised returns which some have already taken up. The community he has built seems to be very invested and helpful to the project as well. The community also gets an opinion on what prices each weekly drop will be, allowing new people to still join without breaking the bank. This means each NFT is being initial released at a fraction of its true value and even being resold still at a cheap price in the NFT space due to its new arrival.  While I continue to look into Tezos Thugs I see lots of rewards for the community to participate in, a very dedicated owner as there’s backstories for the characters(thugs) in the project, even the ability in near future for people to have some sort of input on custom thugs? but I have my doubts that a solo artist can accomplish so many things. Can this project really be the next big thing?  Everyday its certainly pointing towards big accomplishments and a steady path going up. This is why I continue to grab what I can while it’s still early in the project before it gets too big.",0.9743,0.022,0.879,0.099

"So Im an artist. I'm wanting to start selling my art again and the most profitable way seems to be nft buy/sell/trade  So how does one successfully sell nfts? Is it actually profitable? Do smaller creators have any luck in getting people to buy? It's very different from traditional commission work but I loosely understand the idea  I was bored and went ahead and made a sprite sheet with about 70 customization options (hairstyles, ears, jewelry,horns, eyes,eyebrows,clothes,mouths,noses etc) so I could easily mix and match and make a lot in a short amount of time. I also colour each one individually. I made a few today and I'm pretty happy with them  My idea is to every month create a new customizable sprite and I'm going to start animating some of them as well.

They are speaking with a lot of passion and intrigue talking about internet culture like it’s the only real thing in the world. And now I see… this year is the beginning.

There are so many different blockchains out  there and I'm having a hard time choosing the one I want to go with. The  following are the the most important factors for my project in  descending order of importance (i.e. smart contracts are the most  important):  * Complex smart contracts * strong nft support * ease of wallet use * low minting fees * Staking * possibility to create custom Tokens * interoperability with eth * transaction speed  There  are so many blockchains like Harmony, Solana, Avalanche, Cardano,  Fantom etc., but so far from what I've been reading maybe Harmony and  Solana are the most suitable? What are your opinions on this. (maybe  there's also some other blockchain that I just haven't come across yet).  I  haven't mentioned Etherium, since it's crazy high gas fees seem non  feasible currently and who knows when ETH2.0 will come out.  Maybe  someone has some insights on which is the best blockchain to use taking  into account the above mentioned factors. Thank you!",0.9748,0.029,0.796,0.176

"Hello everybody. A very famous friend of mine in the field of sports asked me for an opinion to create a collection of NFTs on behalf of him.   So I decided to create an account of his verified on opensea, and create 3D models of significant objects for his sporting career and put them up for sale. However, to incentivize people to buy these items, I thought of creating a use-case of these items, for example the possibility of being wearable on a metaverse like Sandbox.   However, if you recreate these NFTs on Sandbox, I would lose the ability to create them with the verified account on OpenSea and they would lose their uniqueness. I'm here to ask for advice on how you would act and solve it.   I have one last question: do you think there is a need for a robust marketing campaign? Considering that my friend has millions of followers on Instagram and this news would probably have a high media relevance.

"   **RateMyNFT: We have built the world’s first trust platform for NFT projects.**   **Why:**   Aren’t you sick and tired of getting scammed from NFT projects? Getting scammed sucks and it is a painful experience. Anyone can fake an NFT project. As more and more people get into NFTs, fake NFT projects will continue to increase, and will be very difficult for the average user to validate good projects. To validate fake from authentic NFTs, you kinda need some technical knowledge or background.   **What are we building**   We are building a trust platform that helps you validate fake from real NFT projects. As part of the solution, we built RateMyNFT, the world’s first online platform that primarily allows users to contribute reviews, ratings, upvotes, and discover NFT collections. The platform leverages a crowdsourcing model to acquire ratings. This enables our community to make informed decisions about the validity of specific NFT collections and make comparative assessments of quality, standard, and performance. RateMyNFT is ultimately aimed at solving the problem of NFT scams by giving people the tools to identify fraudulent collections and verify legitimate NFTs.   **We are building for NFT project owners, Hodlers, and the general community.**   Project Owners can list their NFT projects. They have added useful project details like   * Websites * Socials  * Contract address * Creator * Project description * Number of items in their collections.   This helps the general community get a better understanding of the collection listed.   **Hodlers: Minted NFT owners** can rate, review and upvote NFT collections.   The general public can make informed decisions before investing in an NFT project by searching for projects, looking at their ratings, reviews and upvotes.    **Interesting insights:**   Whenever you want to visit a new restaurant, the first step is probably visiting Yelp. Or, you usually check the reviews on Amazon products first before making a purchasing decision. People's perspectives about a product or service are a big value for discovery. We are using such use cases for NFT projects. In fact, people trust strangers when making a purchase online. A recent study showed that 84% of people trust online reviews as much as their friends or families. To minimize fake reviews, NFT hodlers should connect their NFT wallet to leave a review. Connecting a wallet allows RateMyNFT to verify ownership of the project/collection being reviewed. This ensures that each review is legitimate.   **Call to Action:**   We are releasing our first beta to NFT project owners and hodlers. You can list your NFT projects if you have one on our platform and share it with your community so they can add reviews and ratings. To access beta, join our NFT DSC server by checking our product page on product hunt.  Join now and help us build a better trust ecosystem for web 3.0.

"A non-fungible item is, basically, unique – non-interchangeable for other items.   So, that’s the “NF” bit, but how are they tokens?  NFTs stem from the world of cryptocurrencies where digital assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum can be bought and sold like stocks. These assets are based on blockchain technology.  For the most part, NFTs leverage the Ethereum network. Ethereum, which is the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, has the function of allowing users to program their transactions using computer code. These lines of code are known as smart contracts, a set of rules that dictate how NFTs function, including providing their namesake non-fungibility and proof of ownership and managing the transferability of the asset.  This means that when buying an NFT, a token with a unique ID is transferred to your digital wallet. That token proves that your NFT is original and non-fungible, and its presence in your “e-wallet – which only you control and own the password to – is proof that you own it.  So with this in mind, an NFT is a one-of-a-kind (non-fungible) digital asset that leverages the blockchain (token) so it can be governed by a set of rules.  There are many concepts here that most of us don’t use in everyday life (yet) such as smart contracts, blockchains, tokens, and so on, but the idea becomes a bit more digestible when you compare NFTs to anything collectible, like stamps, coins, or trading cards, which are often image-based, scarce or restricted in their numbers, can be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, and are non-fungible.",0.9753,0.013,0.879,0.109
"Like many people, I've recently been getting interested in art NFTs.     One thing that I find interesting is the idea that an artist can sell their work and install a clause that means they get a percentage royalty each time their work is subsequently sold on.     On a podcast I was listening to recently, one of the guests mentioned that there is a risk involved in NFT royalties related to the idea that the financial authorities could consider them to be some type of 'security' - this would make the people associated with the NFT liable to be fully compliant with any legal regulations surrounding securities, or face significant legal penalties.     Does anyone have any experience, a better understanding of this that they would care to share?     I'm still very new to this, so I'm throwing around a lot of words I don't fully understand - so anyone who can fill in the gaps would be great.     Thanks.",0.9753,0.013,0.806,0.182

" A few months ago I found a project   online that at first made me pretty happy, pretty excited actually. A   project called 'Revomon VR' that had been designed by the same team for   Pokemon VR, a wildly popular Sidequest game that allowed players to go   through the Kanto region from Pokemon, with all species available.   Revomon however, was incorporating NFTs and Cryptocurrency. It sounds incredible on the surface, but there are   many issues under the hood.  There   is no further negative criticism on the project aside from the   occasional upset comment on their Twitter, but this is not because it is   a good product.

They will not think beyond the point that this project   is a beta and that NFTs are still gaining headway in the mainstream   audience, and that excuses a percentage of the problems. Game glitches, spawns, moves not working correctly, all of these would be excusable if the product itself didn't try to rehash everything from the   old project it could without facing copyright.  The   Revomon are well designed, but the movesets, abilities, base stats, sometimes typing, and learnable TMs with the exception of several lines   are cut and paste from Pokemon, this includes the starters being exact   replicas of the Kanto Pokemon starters. Gorcano is Fire/Rock, why can  it  learn Roost and Wing Attack? Many moves outright don't work, and   despite this being known for months there have been no adjustments. How   do we know how they are supposed to work? Oh right, their descriptions   have been copied from Pokemon as well. There are few exceptions to the   lazy templates or inspirations the team is using, and though they are   making more unique designs, if I was an investor I would feel very   discouraged by the starting Revomon being Legend of Zelda references   with those aforementioned red flags. Gorlit, Zorelle, and Dekute?   Looking like a Goron, Zora, and Deku Nut? Another red flag. It seems   like they're putting in just enough effort to avoid copyright lawsuits.   Some Revomon are glitched 3 months after introduction, and cannot be   leveled up (Frostoast).  https://preview.redd.it/bh8v4s2vcmj81.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51d62e27a0e27644d3611454aecb66c2768e828c  Legendaries   had started as being a potentially profitable venture, but no longer are worth it at all. this was driven solely by the players and their flooding of the   three maps (of which only 6/10 are actually zones with spawns) where legendaries spawn very rarely, but decreases with each player on   the map. With the amount of people seeking solely these Revomon, the   game would very easily lag, chaos would ensue, and crashes would be   common with only 6+ people on the map at once. How does this project   expect to handle hundreds of players? They say it's a map size issue,   but that only handles player density not what the servers can handle.  The   community can be hostile in-game, players would cover spawns with the   models of their Revomon to prevent others from catching spawns, they   would consistently teleport to one another, or yell and curse when a   rare, shiny, or legendary was found.  Its not uncommon to hear of those   who would cycle through these same maps for 6+ hours a day and then lie   to others about the money potential, just to get more hype for the  game  and maybe drive the price higher. However, from .92 at it's start,  the  currency itself has dipped down to .32 after a abrupt announcement  from  the head development team that burning values for Shinies was  being cut  by half.  This  tore  the community, as there was no explicit mention of a floor price  being  altered only a month after the burn feature was introduced; and  several  other blunders that will be covered; and no announcement prior  to the  change so people could take advantage of one more day of  normal  trading costs  With   this in mind, and the statements of individuals on their team such as   'Sora', the funds from $Revo go directly back into the   game. If this is the case, and they are having this many issues already,   I question if they can even make a functional economy and a successful   coin. They seem to have taken the base lessons learned from Pokemon VR   and instead of trying to make a good game, they just wanted to make a   quick buck. The team themselves have stated that they were a small team   and were struggling to hire further developers, but would not clarify  if  it was a financial issue or just a lack of good candidates.  On the topic of graphics   and gameplay, it's what I would expect. Aim 'Orbs' to catch Revomon,   Battle if you so wish, Run if you don't want to do either and another   Revomon spawns. This ends up causing hours upon hours of the same arm   motion and running from everything in sight just to try to get a rare   spawn, because the lock system makes it so you may not get one unless   you clear enough. On that same topic, if a Revomon is locked to you but   you don't reach it in time, others can grab it. This can be done with   rares, legendaries, or any other Revomon in the game. Many times a   search will continue for several extra hours due to someone else   grabbing an expensive rare tagged to you.  PVP is fun, except the majority of people run the same 6 - 7 Revomon most   of the time and XY (Sometimes Sun/Moon) Smogon tactics work unless you   need Taunt, Baton Pass, or any number of functional non-damaging moves.   Some, such as Sucker Punch don't work at all. If you're going to rip   something off, at least make sure that it works.  The   majority of cities and zones are small but well designed (minus the   seasonal map being a direct copy/paste but with snow ), minus the   massive level jump from around level 5 to level 20 between the first and   second cities, and no healing in the second city but no mart in the   first city. Love the logic here, make your players consistently run back   and forth or just catch the very same things again but leveled up. The   Day/Night function works well and the timed spawns are quite welcomed.  All   in all, it's an alright proof of concept and I have confidence in this   team to eventually create a good game, but the NFT and cryptocurrency   aspect needs to be pushed aside. The game can't support as many players   as it wants to reach and $120,000/month to the community was apparently more than it could sustain, resulting in the   drop of the value of shinies.  The   attention needs diverted, the designs and Revomon need a full overhaul,   and the development team needs to focus on making a good product, not a   good economy solely. What economy will be there if there's nobody to   play the game? ""Truly own what you earn"" is a commonly stated slogan,   but this is a lie in and of itself if as evidenced, those same NFTs you   'own' can go up in smoke at a moment's notice. Hopefully the developers   can pull their head out their ass before the project becomes just   another Nintendo lawsuit, or another Youtube video about a dead game.  https://preview.redd.it/5j4hmfnvcmj81.jpg?width=934&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24f046a1a9081c4a08c2478d7d9199ab7c2f6430",0.9756,0.083,0.815,0.102

"Hi! I'm new at this so be gentle with me.   In 2014 I met Vitalik Buterin when he was finishing the last code lines of Ethereum. He was a young awkward teen with little self awareness for his image. As a fellow World of Warcraft player I wanted to see him succeed so I offered him his first professional portraits. My team and I had a great time giving him this gift and were glad to see his star rise in the following years.  When I shared an old post the other day about this my Facebook feed lit up. I was informed I had the photos of the Genesis of the platform which was the genesis of NFT's, and they could be my Genesis drop. Seeing the meta I went out and acquired [www.EthereumGenesis.com](https://www.EthereumGenesis.com) and this is where I'll be directing updates as they come. There is a video of me on there sharing the story.  What surprised us most was how the photos circulated around the world non stop for the next 8 years. We never licensed the images yet they are in articles for CNBC, on blogs, in memes, youtube videos etc. Not one article mentions the photographer and recently some of the Ethereum founders have been helping me to step up and claim the title for these photos.

SoLads just started minting yesterday and as of now there are 94 Left so if you're quick after reading this, you can likely snatch a few before they hit the secondary market.     I'm big on utility with NFTs, this project has plenty. It started with the idea of just having a DAO that is used to provide fractionalized ownership in blue chip NFTs. (giving average investors a chance at the stability and upside of NFTs they may not be able to afford normally).    There is a 5% royalty on secondary sales that is split 75% to holders, 25% to grow the collection. The same with profits from flips. We also will also hold gaming NFTs that generate profits which will be distributed the same way.    On top of all that, just yesterday it announced we will be bringing in crypto speakers for calls exclusive to SoLads community. The DAO's first vote will be to decide is we want to set aside a portion of profits to hold an in person conference for Lad holders.

"I have never made an NFT but I have been making art for a while. I wanted to create something for my family this year for Christmas — a series of pieces that combine with each other to make a larger work. This is mostly finished and it's a set of 6 physical objects.  Part (not all) of this work is a 6-section digital image, and I was thinking of making it into an NFT series. Each NFT would be linked to the digital image, and would also act as a title of ownership for the corresponding physical work.  Is there any point to doing this? Can I create NFTs basically ""for fun"" without spending much (or any) money? Does everyone in my family have to create accounts and mess with crypto wallets just to receive the NFT for the artwork that I'm physically giving to them on Christmas?

" The spark sparked by the world's obsession with NFTs could be a game changer in terms of fair compensation for artists who make such a significant contribution to our culture.   NFTs are still in the early stages of what they will become in the next few years in terms of product and user experience. Future NFTs will be far more eco-friendly, as they will use far less energy to create blockchains (via advancements like Proof of Stake). Fans will be able to interact with them, making them potentially more valuable than traditional collectibles. Most importantly, they will only be a part of these individual economies, not the whole storey.  Just a few years ago, podcasting, hosting a YouTube channel, and blogging were viewed as hobbies, not professions. Now, any of those paths can be viable entrepreneurial pursuits.  But that’s just past!!  Even telecommunications companies, such as Elite, the first and only telco to use blockchain technology, are adopting the technology. They're also working on a platform for influencers and users, which I think is interesting. My personal favourite is the brave browser, which is revolutionising consumer participation by allowing you to earn bat tokens by watching advertisements. I believe that in the future, the Brave browser will be widely used.  Excited to know what are your thoughts on this creator economy!!",0.9761,0.007,0.863,0.13

"""  If a friend came up to you and asked you, “Hey, what do you think I should buy this week?” what would your answer to this question be?   Will you guide them towards the easy high cap coins, or point them towards trending NFT markets, or set their coordinates at the small capital market?   This is a tough question to ask, no one wants to be responsible for some else’s potential losses. No one wants to be responsible for theirs either for that matter, but it is a weight we have to burden ourselves with. Making decisions for others is hard, even giving them tips is complicated.   This is a financial gamble, let’s be real here. Whatever you answer will change their portfolio, either for the better or for the worse.   I admire recommendations from people, and I always take them, with a grain of salt however. When one of my friends suggested I buy Royal Falcons Club, I fell hesitant at first, but after some study I decided to go forth with it. Because I studied it and it made sense to me, not because they recommended it. If it wasn’t for said friend’s tip, I would not have bought in, and I am grateful.   When I get asked for recommendations, I always ask the other person back: 1.  What’s their risk-reward ratio like? 2.  What aspect of the crypto market are they most interested in? 3.  What their current investments are? These 3 questions probably tell me how their mind operates, and what they are looking for to buy. It’s important that you answer truthfully, and with ideas that are more likely to make it green, than red.   Take advice with a grain of salt, give advice with careful thought.

The idea behind this sketch is the same with some my other artworks: create visual complex result with the basic rules that sometimes has references to the classic generative art technics by repeating a lot of iterations and mixing that classic technics with new possibilities that p5js brings – currently for that sketch is ""random walker"" technics and p5js color mixing and change alpha channel.  The first name of this sketch was ""Painter walk"" but I'm think that it's more looks like a flower, Artificial Flower.  Randomisation based on hash:   1. colour1 and colour2, that randomly selected from the list of 10 colours. If colour1 and colour2 can't be the same color, but sometimes it can be the darker or lighter version of the same color may create 3D effect (alpha also make such effect).   2.

"Not sure if this is the best place to ask, but I'll find out. I'm looking to create some NFTs and have created a smart contract, tested it and now want to deploy it. I was initially thinking of deploying it on the Ethereum Blockchain, but it was crazy expensive. I then started looking at Polygon but trying to get some MATIC had been kind of a hassle, and despite the relative cheapness, I'm not super confident that I'll convince friends to get some MATIC so they can buy the NFTs.  Next I found out about ZK roll-up, and it seems really cool but I haven't figured out if it works with contract deployment. I'm thinking it should since it's just a transaction on the Blockchain, right?  I'd like to deploy on Ethereum, but are there good ways to reduce the price of deploying the contract? Can the ZK rollups help with that? Thanks",0.9766,0.068,0.723,0.209

"Hey just a basic question since I have trouble wrapping my head around this- so digital assets have value for sure, we learned this when TF2 started releasing hats back in 2009 or even earlier when people sold RuneScape gold.  But why does something need to be on the blockchain for it to have extraordinarily high value? I get that there's value in security but I see people having their NFT accounts hacked all the time and I the security of digital assets elsewhere seems to be just as secure- RuneScape gives every item a specific ID and tracks their transfer, TF2 does as well. Everything tradable on Steam is tracked by a very secure central server. Why are digital trading cards any different?

"Good morning everyone and Happy Christmas!  One of my very good friends works in real estate and formerly was a broker. He is known for being pretty tech-savvy. Over the last few months, a number of former clients have approached him (UHNWI individuals) and essentially said, ""Hey we want to invest in NFTs, but want to have someone take care of it for us."" Their financial advisors have no idea how to do it, nor figure out value, negotiate, etc. so they have approached my friend for advise. We're talking 6-7 figure+ investments here.  So we have been chatting about this for a bit and obviously it is something we may jump into if we can streamline the process. Both of us own some Crypto and have a decent foundational knowledge of it, but are far from NFT experts.  Here is my question: How are brokers (if there are any yet) handling the actual sale process with NFTs. Most exchanges as of now seem to be like Ebay, where one can bid or buy. In most expensive goods deals, brokers don't actually have (or want) access to their clients money, instead an attorney (or third party) holds funds in escrow for a deal to happen. I figure theres probably a way to make deals with multisignature wallets where three keys are made and two are needed to unlock (and the broker holds one of them), and that would essentially make the broker the escrow agent.  All advise is appreciated. Thank you.",0.9774,0.02,0.852,0.128

My question is this,   If in the smart contract you can set up that randomization as you want it.  Basically every asset is taken and then blended and randomized into unique products.  If I have to animate these assets into After Affects how do I separate out videos to then be overlayed and randomized like these still images?

"The details are not fully defined yet, and only a few NFTs have been discussed so far, but I think getting an NFT for every movie ticket you buy is a cool idea.  I know many people that collect movie stubs as a sentimental way of remembering the time spent at that movie. I’d be interested to see unique NFTs created for every big blockbuster movie. Every ticket comes with an NFT, as well as a few 1/1 uniques that can be released at auction.   I’d be interested to see how that plays out. What do other think?",0.9776,0.0,0.764,0.236

I’ve only heard about them in vague terms like the steps were, “Buy an NFT, ???, Get Rich!” Are they like stocks where an NFT changes value and you buy them while they’re cheap and sell when expensive? Sell them to who? I asked my pop and he compared it to old-timely  art where it was a way to hold your wealth in a way that couldn’t be taxed, like spending $100,000 on a painting so that $100,000 couldn’t be taxed and selling it when you want to spend.

"It's sad that we as humans have allowed the artwork to be so long underestimated since the advent of the internet when absolutely anything can be copied and pasted without the creator's permission. But today, NFTs are assisting artists in resolving this critical issue by ensuring ownership of each digital work - an NFT owner owns just the token itself, not the underlying item or any connected copyright.     If you believe the hype, NFTs are poised to transform the art world (I truly believe so), changing not only how art is bought and sold, but also what kind of art we value, and which artists. Justin Sun, a prominent tech entrepreneur who has spent millions on NFTs, said “revolutionize the existing trading model in the art market, especially for digital art.” Hmm, what do you think about that?     In general, to make NFT arts, art NFT marketplaces are the solution. The user can mint their digital artwork into NFT by uploading it on the marketplace platform. But ofc we have a lot of different types of marketplaces, I'm into skating whole my life, so as an artist I would probably upload my NFT on a Sk8coin if it has anything to do with skateboarding ofc. They're supporting skaters, sports clubs, artists, etc. So, as you can see there are a lot of options where you can mint and upload your NFT artwork.      NFTs are here to stay and the elevation of the art NFT marketplace will be great and extraordinary. What's your opinion?",0.9778,0.026,0.859,0.114

"So, I've been a believer in crypto since 2017, and believe assets like btc/eth are here to stay. But, it's been much harder for me to take NFTs seriously. I understand their potential functions/benefits but, at the same time, it's very clear (to me at least) that the space is in a price bubble and many involved are more concerned with making a quick buck than anything else.  All that being said, I'm still somewhat interested in perhaps investing in one or two reasonably priced NFTs (no more than $500), and hopefully seeing their value increase over the next few months.   I've browsed opensea, but I'm having a real hard time zeroing in on potential smart investments. Can anyone suggest some NFT projects that are reasonably priced today but appear poised to break out in 2022?   Crypto trunks is one project that caught my eye.

Is it easier for you to use a specialized marketplace for each sphere, such as a Nifty Gateway to buy music NFT, or does it make no difference? That nOFTEN marketplace is quite unique due to NFT collections from celebrities such as Hollywood and Bollywood stars, independent singers, rappers, fitness gurus, stand-up comedians, and so on, which might serve as a blueprint for how it will appear in the future. That may be one of my favorite discoveries in the previous several months of this digital innovation boom.

The core characteristics of digital currency mainly reflect three aspects:  1. Due to some open algorithms, the digital currency has no issuer, so no one or institution can control its issuance;  2. Since the number of algorithm solutions is determined, the total amount of digital currency is fixed, which fundamentally eliminates the possibility of inflation caused by the excessive issuance of virtual currency;  3. Since the transaction process requires the approval of each node in the network, the transaction process of digital currency is sufficiently secure.  The emergence of Bitcoin presents a huge challenge to the existing monetary system. Although it belongs to virtual currency in a broad sense, it is essentially different from virtual currency issued by network enterprises, so it is called digital currency. Digital currency is compared with electronic currency and virtual currency from the aspects of the issuer, the scope of application, issuance quantity, storage form, circulation method, credit guarantee, transaction cost, transaction security, etc.  Wanna invest in top NFTs?

"TLDR: will the low nft project creation cost of entry eventually devalue NFTs as a whole?  In the future there will be lots of big projects, but since all you need to create a smart contract is some code and 3 thousand dollars, do y'all think there will be a problem with people copying projects that have limited supply to add more supply to the world.     Example of what I mean:   Lets say 5000 virtual real estate spots get sold, and they have value because there's only 5000 and more than 5000 people people want that virtual real estate. So then any random person on the internet that knows what they're doing can offer the exact same thing but in more supply.     I'm hoping that this will be solved by complex code that is hard to replicate, but simple things will always be sold, and then could be easily replicated for only a couple thousand dollars. (That's just if its on ETH, SOL is much cheaper). I feel like this could eventually devalue the entire NFT market due to the low cost of entry.  This has always happened in capitalism, people copying something profitable, but the cost of entry and work required is usually so much greater than it would be with NFTs.    P.S.

"Hi everyone, almost 10 months ago I was experimenting with NFT and I thought about mixing surrealistic art and old photos of my sadly dead cat.    The idea is simple but quite interesting for me: I had( and I still have ) dreams about my cat( her name was Luna btw), and I thought about mixing my old pics with surrealistic arts to, in some way, give life to my dreams, because in my sleep I have distorted memories of Luna. I really had a strong connection with my cat and I think I am sort of giving her another life with my work, at the same time I find it interesting to play with the world of dreams.    I'd like this to be the beginning and not the end of this work.

"I believe you have all seen the news related to the World's First NFT Restaurant in NYC opened by Gary Vaynerchuk!    I think this is phenomenal news because this branch of industry is finally joining us!     The upcoming Flyfish Club restaurant is being billed as the first to sell memberships through non-fungible tokens, offering high-end private dining as demand for digital assets has soared. According to Fortune magazine, the seafood-inspired restaurant will open in 2023 in New York City and will feature a cocktail lounge, a 150-seat dining room, an outdoor space at a location that's yet to be announced, and a 14-seat Japanese ""omakase"" room in a private section, yummy!     Some of the features of this restaurant are that the members-only Flyfish Club will require members to pay for their access with crypto, the restaurant and its outdoor space will span more than 10,000 square feet in ""an iconic New York City location"" that has yet to be determined. I would love to see that!     There are more and more business projects and activities like this, and I enjoy the whole idea.   In addition to restaurants, hotels are joining as well, we found out recently that the Venetian hotel has joined this way of business.     A friend of mine who may be more interested in this whole story than me, given that he has been in the hotel business for many years, pointed out a new NFT project called Last Hopium, which will offer its clients various benefits related to hotels, restaurants, spa centers, etc.     So the conclusion of this whole story is that the hospitality industry is back in business after the pandemic!

"Hello. Recently, I began to notice a strong growth of the NFT market on NEAR, it is starting to gain popularity and the collections there are growing in price quite well. I was especially surprised by    Near Punks, which for a long time could be minted by everyone for only 7 $ NEAR. Now I see that Punks go for 50 100 200 NEAR and some more also gave good growth for NFT from the ASAC collection. Marketplaces also do not stand still and, for example, on Paras, you can stake NFTs from some collections with large APRs. While the competition there is small and there is little scam. Therefore, I believe that the opportunities and prospects are excellent, and besides, there are a lot of funds from the NEAR fund.",0.9789,0.023,0.75,0.227

"**The artwork**   I've been following NYM Studio for a couple of months now and the art is just unreal. They're currently developing vibrant NFTs around the natural world with some insane colour combinations. The artwork has been created by different artists, many of them coming from the community itself.

They've teamed up with a number of NFT communities and projects, and are continuously bringing in rising artistic talent to develop more within the space. The team trying to create an exclusive range at the moment only minting a small range of NFTs from this collection, so I think this may hold more of a value increase than a standard 10k collection.

So it leads me to believe this isn't just a cash grab or classic rug. I think they have the capital backing to really see out the project and develop more, which could see the price of the first mint dramatically increase in value for holders.   This is one of the few new projects that pop up that I genuinely believe could be the next blue-chip NFT that could develop a brand. Feels like getting in on the ground floor, as the mint date is next month.

That how** [**fxhash.xyz**](https://fxhash.xyz) works - it's directly JS HTML Cavans API NFT and each new iteration is random and based on uniq hash.  ☮️🌸☮️🌸☮️🌸☮️🌸☮️🌸☮️🌸  You can check it by the link [https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/9238](https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/9238)  The first version was made at 2016 year. That time I was experiment with random walkers. The idea behind this sketch is the same with some my other artworks: create visual complex result with the basic rules that sometimes has references to the classic generative art technics by repeating a lot of iterations and mixing that classic technics with new possibilities that p5js brings – currently for that sketch is ""random walker"" technics and p5js color mixing and change alpha channel.  The first name of this sketch was ""Painter walk"" but I'm think that it's more looks like a flower, Artificial Flower.  Randomisation based on hash:  1. colour1 and colour2, that randomly selected from the list of 10 colours. If colour1 and colour2 can't be the same color, but sometimes it can be the darker or lighter version of the same color may create 3D effect (alpha also make such effect). 2. Amount of walkers (lines) 3. Each walker has uniq size, lifespan and walk path 4. I hope that I didn't forgot to mention something that also use fxhash randomisation.  I hope you will like it. Soon I will publish more new sketches and was adapt and publish my old sketches that was made in period from 2012 to 2019 year. Some of artworks from my profile are new.

"Before  I get into this post, I'd just like to mention that this isn't being  done by Microsoft themselves officially. But basically NFT Worlds is a  project built on third-party Minecraft servers with a Polygon-based  overlay. Think of it as minecraft with access to Web3 features, such as  an online shop where they can buy items for their Minecraft experience  using the $WRLD ERC-20 token.  I think this could be something that is really going to push P2E and the  blockchain to the next level \*IF\* they do it right. I feel like there's a  lot of ways where this could go wrong but for the sake of optimism.  We're going to assume it goes really well.  Minecraft  is huge and a project like this going well is going to be bringing in a  LOT of eyes to P2E and the Polygon chain as a whole. I've been already  thinking it's leading the P2E charge and this could push it to the next  level.  I'm not really a minecraft  guy but you cannot deny how cool this is. Seeing web2 and web3 begin to  intertwine like this could be the start of something huge and I'm  personally incredibly excited to see what else we can come up with.",0.9795,0.029,0.819,0.152

"""I don't mean to sound condescending, but I see people here every day either trashing a new project or pushing away a new asset. Why? Why won't you have faith in something and hold on to the end?  This is especially the case for NFTs, where most people will pass it up as a zoomer toy and decided against putting their money's worth in. Sometimes, the projects you diss make a person a millionare, and you will still be the same sob behind a screen calling them lucky and dumb.   Look at some NFT projects, some pieces are literally too good to pass up. Some projects and ideas look like successes already, any veteran investor will tell you so...  Some projects, like for example the Royal Falcons Club are creating a stir, and their ideas are bound to break in the market. Other projects like small cap gems are gathering heat and are brewing up a storm.   Don't be sorry, try out your hand in something you believe in!""",0.9797,0.052,0.757,0.191

The acquisition of one of these tokens gives the holder exclusive access to physical and digital events, as well as to the commercial rights of the character of their NFT.

"I decided to try my hand and start my own Nft collection — actually 2 but they are separate from eachother.  My understanding in NFTs and the NFT community is minimal and therefore would love some insight into what this is all about and know 1. How I could get better at it and promote my stuff to actually sell and 2. Can I do it alone?   I’ve noticed a lot of people already have brands and sites attached to their work and a reason to their NFT collection. I have also noticed a lot of creators have 3K or more people workin with them. Can this be done alone? Can this be done without a site or a brand or a game attached??   My first collection is something my son wanted me to do. I created some small little pets that are literally his stuffed animals brought to life with different textures, outfits, etc.   My second collection is something more detailed and more my style. It’s related to nature and over 20% of the profits made will be donated to the Environmental Defense Fund.   Both are on opensea but tbh… they aren’t going anyway.

Yes NFT JPEGs are a form of digital art at the end of the day. But because they’re linked to a unique tag on the blockchain they can offer much more than just a cool looking picture.  A lot of NFTs are not offering services and exclusive access to important place and contacts kind of like the BAYC collection on the upcoming Last Hopium collection.  A lot of these NFTs even end up being rented to certain people with the owner gaining profit from the the NFT while still owning it on the blockchain.  I think this offers a huge hidden benefit that many people don’t account for when comparing NFTs with conventional art.,0.9801,0.0,0.769,0.231

"Hello guys, we had a little chat the other day after reviewing someone's nft collection on reddit. After the conversation, I got his permission. I wanted to share this with you too. The story of the creation of this person's collection was very interesting to me, I had never encountered such a situation before. I think I'll pass it on to you in the form of a quote as stated by the author.   &gt;Here's the story of the GraffitiApeOriginal collection.   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;Contrary to popular belief, the works in the collection are products of artificial intelligence. It must be because I am very interested in Ape business, on January 12, 2022, a 3-headed Ape entered my dream. He said that they wanted to reveal the world of NFT for about 1800 years. He said they had been in contact with people who could help them for years. When I browsed the internet a little bit to see if someone else wrote this story, I came across some examples. As you know, our internet network was not that advanced even 50 years ago. That's why he said they were ready after 1800 years. He said that they appealed to many people with the trend they caught in 2021. The 3-headed Ape I spoke to was the leader of all the apes. As I am someone who is interested in deep learning. He told me the changes I needed to make to my AI models. Said the errors in my algorithm and the new parameter values. When I integrate these values ​​into my software, the works that come out are the same as the works in the collection. He said they made room for themselves in the meta universe and their population increased because of us. He stated that they came into contact with the human race 1800 years ago. But he said they could not communicate effectively with the primitive peoples. He said that thanks to our current technology, we can communicate with them more easily. He said that we can advance our life in friendship.   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;A new artifact will be added for each artifact purchased. Because they don't want me to disclose their race.

How does NFT relate to IPO? But, that is true.  How to associate NFT with IPO? Then we have to talk about DAO, and we have to talk about [VORG](https://vorg.io/).  [VORG](https://vorg.io/) is a decentralized virtual organization registry. Virtual organizations refer to individuals, teams, companies, etc.  It seems that [VORG](https://vorg.io/) has a relationship with the DAO, as both involve organizations. Yes, a virtual organization is a kind of DAO.  So what is the relationship between DAO, NFT, and IPO?  Let’s talk about DAO and NFT first. Every DAO on [VORG](https://vorg.io/) is unique, in other words, its name is unique. This is also a manifestation of non-fungible.  Next, let’s talk about DAO and IPO. Every DAO on [VORG](https://vorg.io/) can issue its own shares (not coins). This also means that the total number of shares of each DAO can be increased. That is, every DAO has the ability to continuously raise funds on demand. And, these shares can be traded directly on [VORG](https://vorg.io/).  In addition, the name of DAO is not just a mnemonic, it is also a domain name. A domain name that can be used to build a website, for example: *vorg.v* (you need to start the [VORG](https://vorg.io/) DNS Router before the browser access it).  Finally, there are a series of conditions in [VORG](https://vorg.io/)’s contract to try to guarantee the interests of creators and investors.  On how to create a virtual organization and IPO, you can refer to [the previous article](https://medium.com/@vorg-npc/vorg-decentralized-company-and-domain-name-registrar-84f5b15c6224).",0.981,0.007,0.872,0.121
" •    What is this CMS and how does it work?  CMS uses the existing Watt mining farm (Their hydro plant ) as our physical mining host for hardware and related software. CMS owners become participants in the mining pool, where each Miner generates a certain amount of hash power and ultimately mining rewards for each holder.   CMS is orchestrated by an experienced team of well-seasoned crypto miners, who have been in the mining industry dating back since 2011. They work in partnership with their sister company called Watt Technologies LLC, the central hub committed to Green Cryptocurrency Mining supported through renewable energy and the provision of clean underground water reserves. They particularly specialize in:  - Building hydro stations - Renting out space for mining facilities - Securing clean underground water reserves - Remote cryptocurrency mining  •    Features and benefits of a CMS  -Monthly cryptocurrency rewards (0.001 to 1.0 ETH) mined by their own mining rig facility for 24 months -Eligibility for Watt token airdrop -Access to their mining rig should you wish to send your miner and rent their space with low-entry electricity prices -A cool and unique ASIC Miner inspired artwork signifying your digital ownership  There are few utilities besides mining, which are:  - access to the hydro power stations - access to cheap electricity as low as 0.02$ per kWh - play and earn games just for CMS holders",0.981,0.021,0.832,0.147
"  [create pixel art, and own what you create](https://i.redd.it/85iewcn2vg681.gif)    Everyone remembers the glory of Reddit's r/place \- the 2017 Reddit experiment where users could place a coloured tile in a grid. What followed was 72 hours of Reddit legend, with over a million people claiming their piece of the grid. Communities formed (looking at you, Blue Corner), some of which are active to this day!  But at the end of the day, if you created something amazing on r/place, did you get anything for it?  Enter 8bitart.gallery - a platform for dynamic NFTs, written straight to the Ethereum blockchain. Each pixel is a purchaseable NFT - which can be bought competitively until the auction ends. Having your pixel bought earns you a tidy profit, and those possessing a pixel at the end of the auction automatically own a share of the final canvas when it is minted as an NFT, and can claim profits from its sale!",0.9811,0.0,0.827,0.173

"Super shill here but I’m putting together an NFT project to fund the first multiplayer, stake to earn video game in WEB 3.0. I’m also working with an artist to release a TV Show, this was more of an extra that I added after but had the idea after I realized how good a show about this would be. Fully animated TV Show. We’re in super early stages and don’t have a website yet but if you want to check out our twitter you can here: twitter.com/blooddomenft   Also tell me what you think, would you help find a tv show and game by buying an nft or not?   I’m also kind of on the fence about whether to choose Solana or L1 Ethereum for the nft, which one is better? I think Solana because it opens more doors for people that otherwise couldn’t afford it but I’d love to know what you think.",0.9811,0.0,0.839,0.161
"Laura-Marie Geissler, a German GT racer, is forming the first NFT-sponsored motorsport team. So, the intriguing aspect is that whether she earns the necessary cash to compete in the coming season will be entirely reliant on her fans, because the LMG racing team has chosen to forego external sponsors in order to finance Geissler's race season through NFT sales.     After reading this post about Laura, I've seen that racing sports are incorporating crypto and NFTs into their operations. Football was the first to do so, but now we're seeing that trend spread to other sports, including racing. I'm saying this because I've recently heard of K4 Rally, they have their own racing team with professional rally champion Johannes Keferböck and one of the best rally co-drivers in the world Ilka Minor, and K4 also has something to do with NFTs, as K4 Rally is the first cross-blockchain NFT rally game ever.     It's fascinating to watch how all of this develops, seemingly overnight. You are surely aware that F1 is already adopting NFTs the most of any racing sport. Do you have any interesting news about racing or NFTs?",0.9811,0.0,0.871,0.129
"So there was lately a lot attention to a project called Color Museum. Those guys going to release a series of 10k NFTs just containing a color of your choice. Not gonna lie, the project has a very cringy pitch: It says, that you take ownership on the associated color just by owning the NFT. Social media replied unisono that this project sucks because there is no way to gain a legal ownership on a color at all. Well they are right.  BUT!  This is actually not what they are trying to achieve! Instead, Color Museum is aiming to be a new NFT marketplace with an innovative revenue model: Fees will be shared according to the colours contained in the traded NFTs, so the color 'ownership' is only related to the traded NFTs on their marketplace!  1.25% is the transaction fee that the marketplace will charge to the buyer and the seller for completed trades. Lets say, you own an NFT with a specific dark red which is actually contained by 10% in a just sold NFT, you get a 10% share of the trading fees!  In conclusion I think there is a huge chance the NFT series itself will be very scarce! The [waitlist](https://color.museum/?referralCode=BxYUWgAN5) is still open, so you still have a chance to grab your favorite colors first!  Cheers!",0.9812,0.015,0.846,0.14
"Yesterday I was thrilled with the news that the son of the one and only John Lennon will organize an NFT auction of valuables from his father's collection, and today I came across similar news that may have made me even happier!     There will be another NFT auction in February in memory of another phenomenal musician, Kurt Cobain, frontman of the band Nirvana!   God, how much I loved their music and the whole period while they were current, I gladly remember.     The auction itself will be organized on Cobain's birthday on February 20, and as an auction item will be exhibited NFT photographs that have not been seen so far, which are from the Nirvana concert in Philadelphia on October 1, 1991. The auction includes four NFT tokens in GIF format, made from five previously unpublished recordings, at a starting price of 67 Ethereum (ETH).     As someone who is a big fan of music, I started looking for Music NFT Marketplaces and Platforms and came across a few that I liked a lot, such as Foundation, Centaurify, and NiftyGateway.     This kind of news from the music world always makes me happy, especially since both musicians and production companies keep up with the times and understand the importance of NFTs. This is a win-win situation both for them and for us who are fans and collectors.",0.9812,0.0,0.873,0.127

FOR LIFE (as long as you hold the NFT).  Exclusivly, if you get one of these MovieNFT's, you will also recieve the physical prop in real life.  Aka you get a :    1. MovieNFT 	      2. a real movie prop       3. profit shares of Russell Crowe's new movie 'The Prizefighter'        We've teamed up with a few films to be able to exclusivly give you unique NFT's with utility.

"# Great people, I'd appreciate it if you'd take three minutes and read what I want to ask 🙏  (English isn't my native language so don't mind the mistakes).  (I'm going to ask this question in other subreddits too so that as many people as possible can see my question)  I've always been interested in cryptocurrencies and things like that but I never started studying and seeing what it was. As far as I can tell, ***cryptocurrencies***, ***nft's***, etc are widely used in America and other major countries, whereas, at least in my country, they're not used that much. I just want to get on with it, but I don't know where to start. And after so many videos and texts on the internet, I still don't understand it.  **My question is, can you write me the first steps to enter the world of cryptocurrencies (I'm a complete beginner), literally what should I know all the way from the beginning.**  What are some specific videos or texts that I can start with to understand what it is, how it's used; how did you start your cryptocurrencies journey? etc  I guess on the internet people charge for services where they teach others how to profit from cryptocurrencies etc (like there are courses where English or any other language is taught and people charge for their knowledge) but I just want the basics where I can understand what's going on (I am getting thousands of posts on IG about this subject which I cant relate to) I've also heard of ***Metaverse***, and I'm interested in that too, it sounds so futuristic, something like Sims and Matrix in one place idk.  I may have written too much text for a such simple question, but I didn't know how to do it in any other way. This is the first time I've asked a question somewhere on the Internet so anyone that can help, help.🙏 Any advice is welcome. Thank you in advance.",0.9816,0.005,0.894,0.101

"So I've recently stumbled across a project that states in its white paper that they are looking to change the social experience around NFT's. Upon further investigation, through the amazing chat rooms, I have come to understand their concept a bit more as a museum to share and display one's creative essence. This really sounds interesting to me and wanted to get others' take on this idea. Marketplaces are spinning up left and right, there is not much special sauce around ""just another NFTbay"" so to speak. I'm pretty excited to see what the project ends up turning into, the team is great and it has an amazing community.  What would really drive a Museum of NFT creativity home to you as a social platform?  Would you get excited about this?  How could this be different, what functionality would you want to see?

"""Is the software of crypto holding us back from our full potential? Well, honestly, I think so. Think how far technology has come and how that has affected crypto itself. If you read up on the Bitcoin itself, you will come to understand that mining back in the day was way different than it is today. Back then, people used to mine on their laptops as a background process, it was almost nothing and powered by CPUs only. When powerful GPUs arrived, quickly mining skipped a beat and it was almost impossible to compete without a powerful GPU as well. And now you need a whole rig to be able to even slightly make a profit.   Thankfully, Satoshi foresaw this. He made mining difficulty a thing to battle this technological progress. He knew tech moves up in an exponential curve and tech quickly advances.   With this said, it is important to say, that the power of crypto is only limited by the power our current tech holds. When tech advances, so does everything else.   This is important to understand that, crypto can only get better and more efficient as we drift forward in time. Better mining networks will be implemented, as we have seen with the theory ADA is trying to apply. Better use cases will be made for crypto, and especially for NFTs, as we are seeing with the reward theory Royal Falcons Club is trying to apply.   Technological will move forward, and it will move crypto forward as well. Crypto is limited by technological power, and their relationship is mutual. """,0.9819,0.041,0.812,0.146

"Think of anything, literally anything and you could turn it into an NFT or implement NFTs into it.    NFTs aren’t just tied to art. We’ve already saw how it was implemented in real estate with things like Decentraland and Sandbox. We also saw the rise of NFT gaming with profitable yet also entertaining games like Legends of Elumia (which I think will be the most likely sector of NFTs to make the market go mainstream eventually).    We’re also seeing people gaining passive income from their NFTs through renting them out. You got NFTs like  Last Hopium that offer access to some of the most exclusive restaurants and hotels along with very important contacts.    People could definitely benefit from NFTs in multiple ways and the fact is that there are still things that haven’t been explored when it comes to NFT utility so this will only get better and better.",0.9823,0.0,0.802,0.198

Im so tired of games like Axie Infinity where the game itself isn’t really that interesting other than the fact that it generates profits.  There are games out there like Monster Galaxy which are actually very entertaining and have great graphics and game mechanics while still generating the same amount of profits.  The difference is that the focus isnt based on profits alone. This is exactly why I’m also bullish on projects like ENGN which is working on introducing the popular games we’re used ti playing on regular gaming into the NFT universe.  This will definitely provide a nice kick to the NFT games we currently have.,0.9824,0.039,0.685,0.275

"There are more and more music stars who buy a large number of NFTs and spend a lot of money on them, they also sell NFT collections to their fans and collectors. We’ve had the opportunity to hear that even a big music event like The Brit Awards has partnered with the NFT platform and there is more and more news like this.     That's why people have become interested more than ever in certain music platforms that are becoming so popular, in my opinion, one that stands out and that I especially like to use is an NFT platform called Centaurify.     Did you hear the latest news that the American rapper Snoop Dogg, who recently disclosed that he is pseudonymous NFT collector u/CozomoMedici, has purchased another non-fungible token for $3.9 million in ETH? Snoop Dogg has been proactive in the NFT space. As a result, he attracted a partnership with The Sandbox, an upcoming metaverse game based on the Ethereum game. The game allows players to build, own, and monetize their gaming experiences.     I have the impression that he has just started buying it and that he understands the importance of NFTs and sees the potential of it, that it will grow in the future.

"Hi, I've been attempting to wrap my head around this for a minute now and I think I'm in need of community input on the matter to clarify my understanding of how nft's work.  So I think I have a reasonable understanding for the idea behind an nft, but so we're on the same page I'll say what I think it is and you can correct me if I am wrong.    My understanding is that it is a means to take a digital asset and attach an ID/Token to it saying that this specific copy of it is the real deal and thus is unique, and as such has value.    Now onto the bits that I am looking for more input on:     1. From what I was able to google up there can be more than one nft for a given piece of art. So if that is the case, can anyone just take an image and mint it as their own, then potentially profit from it? Additionally, if there can be multiple nfts per asset, where does the value originate from? (my confusion is that, if anyone can just make their own unique copy of it, would those copies not have the same value? why or why not?) 2. As I was able to understand from some content about web 3.0, the idea with the nft is to give a piece of the internet to the user instead of big corporations. I am confused as to how that works? I get that the blockchain would say that this particular asset is owned by X, but it would still be likely hosted some place where the owner of the art does not have absolute control over it. Say if it's an image on imgur, you can share it or delete it as you want.. but technically so can imgur, but they chose not to. Or is there something inherently different about an asset that's minted which would make it so only the owner of this piece of web3 can chose what happens to it? 3. Are there any counter measures for manipulation by large community owners? Say if I had a large community for nft's and we published a variety of news and exciting developments there. We could also publish featured pieces of art from our community, which we thought were cool/good. If I had per-purchased said art before the announcement I could profit from it tremendously (I think?). Is there something to prevent this type of behavior?  I'd like to re-iterate that my goal is not to have a laugh about this or anything along those lines. I am looking to have a civilized conversation and hopefully learn something more than I knew before hitting post.",0.9826,0.035,0.866,0.099

"   These days on all social networks I am reading about the new era of blockchain technology and the most important ways we can expect it to develop in 2022.   One of the most common themes is the NFTs, especially sports-driven NFTs and Metaverse projects. There are only a few licensed marketplaces for sports NFTs, NBATopShots, soccer Sorare, Rario for cricket, and a few others, and all of them are gaining popularity really fast.   As I understand, those sports fans evolved with technological advancement and realized it is much easier to obtain and collect digital collectibles than to run after their favorite stars for autographs. Most importantly is the fact that once you purchase NFT, it is locked and secured on the blockchain, and if you decide to resell it with a profit or buy a new one, it is only a few clicks away. This new way of collecting is also better because those collectibles are becoming available to all fans worldwide, not just those close to sports courts, so for example soccer fans (3.4 billion) or cricket ones (2.5 billion) could be potential buyers of those NFTs and in that light, it all makes sense.   Rario team has built a marketplace where anyone can easily collect some moments from cricket games. These moments are all licensed.  Sports NFTs are conquering the fans' hearts, and on some of those collectibles, owners made huge profits after some time.",0.9826,0.0,0.87,0.13

"I read recently that in Seattle, a physical NFT museum will open, with the goal of providing a tangible place dedicated to celebrating NFTs and boundary-pushing artists.    They will host a variety of NFT-related shows, with a focus on exhibiting artwork created by Seattle-based artists.     Here's a thought: I would like to be the owner of some art piece that could cost more than I could pay, and the artist or museum that sells the piece could really benefit from it, and it doesn't have to wait for a rich investor to buy it.   And we could contribute to the artists that create their work by both buying physical item itself and digital representation of it.     When it comes with the concepts of metaverse and VR, you also get functionalities through decentralized concepts, like apps, governance etc. that open new ideas that could give birth to much more. It think the possibilities will be mostly limited by creativity, since technology in this space is rapidly evolving.

"""  We are early to to crypto. That's true. But being early doesn't mean there is no innovation going around in the crypto space.

So the way it works is simple: token holders vote in a DAO from a number of possibilites to choose from. It could be DeFi 3.0 project or yield earning projects.   And once the voting ends, the selected one gets bought from the treasury.

I realize all of this digital stuff is very speculative right now, and I have lost a little bit of money jumping into cryptocurrency (more important to have my money in the bank right now, and the prices crashing AGAIN governments wanting to regulate and tax it got me worried), but this does seem to be the way the world is going.

I think TerminalMontage Jeremy could potentially sell his characters in his artsyle as NFTs, (he's released videos showcasing a bunch of Nintendo and other game characters in his artstyles), but I'm not sure if Nintendo and/or the other videogame companies would sue for that, if that is considered copyright infringement at the point of directly selling for money? (Because it'd be out of the context of parody at that point, or would it? I don't know how far copyright infringement allows or doesn't allow).  I also realize already having a massive fanbase helps to have people to sell to, especially for such large price tags, but things go viral, sometimes, and sharing on Reddit may help with that.......  I was wondering if creating fanart in an existing franchise's artstyle, to sell as NFTs, would be considered copyright infringement, and if in this particular case, I could or would get sued by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, Viacom Studios (Comedy Central/MTV), Nintendo, Marvel, Microsoft, or any other company/brand who I used to base artwork off of (say I created Spiderman or even a real person like Elon Musk, as South Park characters) could or would sue me for using their works to try and sell artwork based off of them.  Isn't it generally considered more fairuse when parodying/depecting real people, especially politicians or celebrities?

"Over the past year, different words in the cryptocurrency ecosystem have become more popular, while others have maintained their level of interest. This is evidenced by the searches people around the world have been doing for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance, Metaverse and NFT (non-fungible tokens).    According to Google Trends data, the most searched word of the five has been bitcoin, beating Ethereum, Binance, Metaverse and NFT by more than 77% globally.    The country that has googled bitcoin the most out of all the countries in the world is El Salvador. This makes sense considering that in 2021 it became the first and only place in the world so far to officialise its use as a national currency. The other Spanish-speaking countries where it was most searched are Spain at number 25, Venezuela at number 27 and Argentina at number 28 in the world ranking.    Below, almost on a par, are Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency, and Binance, a platform that allows you to buy and sell cryptoassets. As can be seen in red and purple in the Google Trends graph, both words maintain a similar line of interest throughout the year, although towards the end of the year they have been overtaken by the key word of the moment: NFT.    Argentina, Spain and Venezuela are the Hispanic countries where Ethereum was most searched for, although none of them is positioned among the first 24 places in the world ranking. Binance, on the other hand, has attracted more interest in the region, mainly in Venezuela, considering that it is the second most searched country in the world. The following countries are El Salvador in 12th place, Argentina in 13th place and Spain in 19th place.    While there are two words that have slightly increased their interest. These are NFT since February with greater intensification at the end of the year and metaverse since October.    Venezuela is the third country in the world that has googled NFTs the most, surpassing Spain in 33rd place and Argentina in 37th. As reported by CriptoNoticias, a third of the Venezuelan population already knows what NFTs are, which they recognise as collectible digital art, according to a study by [Finder.com](https://Finder.com).    Regarding metaverse, Venezuela also leads in interest, although only in 53rd place, as the term, which means virtual parallel worlds, is more widely used in Asia. It is followed by Spain, Mexico, Peru, Argentina and Chile.    Google searches serve as a thermometer to measure global and regional interest in a topic. In this sense, the fact that Bitcoin continues to lead the search rankings reflects the fact that, despite the emergence of new concepts that attract media attention, Bitcoin's leadership in this market is maintained.",0.9831,0.006,0.912,0.081

"  Very new to this, so please bear with me on what is likely to be a stupid question.  If I have an image / meme that in an ideal world I want to go viral, is it best to create it as an NFT first? I appreciate I won’t be listing it for sale initially as I would need to know the value which I’d only know by the popularity I’m guessing ?  The reason for my question is, would that protect my ownership of the meme more solidly if I at least created it as an NFT…or should I send the meme out there first, if it goes viral (I’m talking best case scenario as an example) then create the NFT.   Hope this makes sense",0.9833,0.024,0.72,0.256
"So I’m not a boomer and actually like and invest in crypto myself. Also been a currency trader for a few years now   But NFT’s I do not understand. Well I don’t understand the value in these things   Can you guys explain to me how JPEG image some random teen created in his bedroom can be bought for 10,000s.   Where is the value? It’s not physical. You can’t hang it up for it to look nice in your house. Where is the value?   It reminds me of the dot com bubble and anything with .com on the end had a crazy value to it but the company didn’t actually offer much value itself and eventually this bubble burst   Surely it could get to a point where there might not be enough buyers and someone just doesn’t buy your NFT you hoped would sell and then you’ve just spent 10,000 on a random JPEG that you can’t do fuck all with. Not even hang in your house. Like it’s worthless.  So surely all of this is just hoping NFT space will keep growing. (More buyers) because if that stops, this shit will burst. Badly   It reminds me of a pyramid scheme and the people at the bottom are going to get hurt   Please don’t attack. I’m doing my best to understand these things, I’m not hating. Just doing my best to understand any long term value in this.",0.9833,0.115,0.666,0.218

"Hey guys! I am currently travelling the world in my PT Cruiser, and to fund the trip I am selling one NFT for each day that I’m on the road. The goal is to get from the UK to Australia, via the Americas, without any flying whatsoever, and so selling these will really help me on my journey.  However, the NFTs are not just for me! I am really trying to make them valuable to the community, so each NFT offers the following:  - 💵 There will be an ‘Amazing Race’ style competition every quarter, and NFT holders will be able to join (as many times as they like) - First gets $10k, more if the floor rises! - ✈️ Monthly drawings for holidays/flights, and you are automatically added if you hold an NFT - 🎥 Exclusive content from my trip that I don’t publish on Socials - And more! Once the community grows I would love to get it he community involved as to what they want to get out of the NFTs.  It’s a work in progress, but I think these NFTs will have some fantastic real world utility and not just a photo, and I would be honoured if you guys would have a look at my page!

"**Hey crowd,**   I have always believed, even as a child, that words are bigger and can really make a difference. At the same time I never really thought that knowledge, thoughts, opinions ever have the possibility to be perceived as art and have the same chance to grow as a painting, or an artwork.   **Nevertheless, we are everywhere dominated by language**, a tool we actually use every day and yet we often find it hard to deal with it. Well: After working with #NFTs for a few months, I have now set out for the first time and published my first piece on [OpenSea.io](https://OpenSea.io).   **My idea:**    It's a lost diary for the old me with thoughts that have accompanied me on my journey and that may also accompany you on your path through life.

This is the reason why I decided to share my content with the world.

I think it's important and beautiful when individuals deal with it and we simply network and bring human beings together.    Plan for me is to ""plant"" a new thought on OpenSea every 3 days.

"Ok fam, so we are working on this project -- Crypto Yacht Party. Essentially we are creating a DAO with the intention buying a megayacht, sailing it around the world and throwing parties. The NFT gives you access to the parties and some other perks (discussed below).   In order to pull this off we have to raise a lot of money ... like, a lot. I'm talking $25 mil + ... mega yachts aint cheap. With our mint set at 8,888 that means each NFT needs to sell for nearly $3k each ... to get a bigger ship we are looking at the $5k range.    Now I know many NFT's have sold for this amount and much more ... but I've never heard of someone doing a mint at this price point. ... so I figured I'd go straight to the source and ask for feedback.    Would you mint at this price point?  Do you think it would be worth it?   \*\* You get : access to all of our yacht parties (26 /year forever). Can stay on the yacht.

Users are in total control of the production and no other parties can interfere.  ⚡️ **icon\_not\_found**   DECENTRALIZED SUPPLY INCREASE   The R1-Coin algorithm generates 2-5% annual supply inflation to reward the users. R1-Coin is the first coin in the world that provides this opportunity to its users.  ⚡️ **COMMERCIAL USE**   With its algorithmic structure that changes every hour, R1-Coin is perfect for the users who need to make transfers every day. In this way, users who use R1-Coins in their transfers save 2-5% annually.  **⚡️ Regularity**   The change in the number of incentives per hour stimulates the user base. When users are consolidated, their reactions become regular. Regular user reactions affect the price and make it more predictable.  **⚡️ Sustainability**   Unlike other networks, when there is an unusual increase in transfer demand R1-Coin sets the supply, which is generated by the transfers, to zero. Even though it does not balance the demand, it might be the best way to balance supply compared to the inefficiency of the other networks.

I was actually very hyped about the idea of Steam joining the NFT market.  It already has a very valuable digital market for in-game items. Imagine the potential if that was turned into an NFT market.  In fact I think we definitely need something like Steam in this market considering most games aren’t even that entertaining. I’m mostly playing Monsters Galaxy cause so far its the only P2E game that’s actually fun with profits being compromised.  Some good news is that there are some projects like ENGN working on introducing some popular games into the NFT market through giving developers the right tools.

"Yes, I watched the South Park Post COVID Return of Covid special, right after midnight (don’t you love modern day streaming services?) and got inspired by &gt;!Butters&lt;!.  I realize all of this digital stuff is very speculative right now, and I have lost a little bit of money jumping into cryptocurrency (more important to have my money in the bank right now, and the prices crashing AGAIN governments wanting to regulate and tax it got me worried), but this does seem to be the way the world is going.  I also have some interest in creating, hard to get motivated or creative sometimes, but there are literally PICTURES OF ROCKS, selling for millions (supposedly, at least?) These rocks don't even have faces on them or anything, just plain, cartoon rocks.   Logically, it makes no sense, and I'm wondering who the hell has that kind of money, and spends it on this, but supply and demand, I guess?  I'm not grounded in my room with an iPad, but I would like to get in on the making money from home thing.  I think TerminalMontage Jeremy could potentially sell his characters in his artsyle as NFTs, (he's released videos showcasing a bunch of Nintendo and other game characters in his artstyles), but I'm not sure if Nintendo and/or the other videogame companies would sue for that, if that is considered copyright infringement at the point of directly selling for money? (Because it'd be out of the context of parody at that point, or would it? I don't know how far copyright infringement allows or doesn't allow).  I also realize already having a massive fanbase helps to have people to sell to, especially for such large price tags, but things go viral, sometimes, and sharing on Reddit may help with that.......  I was wondering if creating fanart in an existing franchise's artstyle, to sell as NFTs, would be considered copyright infringement, and if in this particular case, I could or would get sued by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, Viacom Studios (Comedy Central/MTV), Nintendo, Marvel, Microsoft, or any other company/brand who I used to base artwork off of (say I created Spiderman or even a real person like Elon Musk, as South Park characters) could or would sue me for using their works to try and sell artwork based off of them.  Isn't it generally considered more fairuse when parodying/depecting real people, especially politicians or celebrities? South Park and Family Guy and tons of other shows do this regularly, but do you run into copyright/legal trouble when you try and sell artwork depicting other companies properties DIRECTLY FOR PROFIT???

"I recently minted some Mutant Kongz Lab nft's and some Doodoodles NFT. The MKL have been revealed, the Doodoodles not yet, but I have a question since I'm kinda new. I listed them on Opensea for a bid, starting at 0.2 WETH. Now my question really is, is this a good price listing? The reason I minted them is because their twitter accounts seem active, not really full of bought followers and their DC is also pretty active. Also I like the art on these. But ofcourse I'm here to make a profit. Anyone has some input if these will be sold or if there will be some interest. I know nobody can predict the future, but maybe some more experience people within the NFT community can give me some tips if these were worth it or if they can see the NFTS grow.",0.984,0.0,0.811,0.189
"Hello NFT community,  I hope you are all having a nice week,  It’s been a long time since I read and learn about NFTs and I’m glad to be part of that innovation. Today I will be pleased to get your help and am looking for your advices, feedbacks, comments and support about a new project launched a few weeks ago.  To keep it short, I’ve been thinking about it since months, the aim was to launch a disruptive NFT art gallery. This project is now named Once Upon An Arcade Gallery, recently upgraded from the concept stage to the production one and is now live and keep going.  If you are intrigued and want more info about it, I’ll be delighted to share additional details with you.  Actions speak better than word, so have a glimpse of it.

So far I was thinking of : Opensea (live) / Rarible (live) / Foundation / Makersplace /Superrare / Hicetnunc * How do you manage to reach more users on those platforms? * Do you have some tips to make your pieces more visible from the community? * I found out that the search algorithm on Rarible is based on the two first keywords of the title, but maybe you have more insights ?  Willing to learn from you all. In the meantime wish you a nice day, the week end is coming sooner than we think (:  Cheers,  Rrmi  PS : When the time is right, I’ll work on a BTC Edition.

"I've been in the hotel business for a long time, and I own several hotels. My business is doing well, but, like all hotel owners, we were affected by the pandemic's situation.     My children tease me with stories about buying NFTs and investing money in the Crypto world in general, claiming that this will help me raise my business.   I must admit that as time passed, my interest in the entire story concerning investing in NFT grew.     Today, virtually anything may be made into NFT, either what we have or what we don't have, but I've noticed that the Hospitality Industry has been neglected in NFT projects until recently, when I came across an article announcing lots of new NFT plans in this industry, particularly in 2022!   So maybe this year is the perfect opportunity for me to deal with this topic as well.     My friend, who also owns a hotel and with whom I've worked for a few years, suggested that I should visit an NFT project called Last Hopium, which looks fantastic and it offers exactly what I want to offer my customers: luxury, luxury hotels, luxury dinners, and more!     I didn't consider investing in something related to my niche at first, but who knows, maybe that's why I'll do well, given that I'm new to the whole story.",0.984,0.038,0.8,0.162
"Concurring events taking place in decentraland hosted by Portion are making community and other experts to take an active participation in metaverse. Cheddar News' Closing Bell interview with Publicis Sapient CEO Nigel Vaz discussion about a recently announced partnership can be a good example.  Publicis Sapient experts in collaboration with Portion have been working a project where users can examine a virtual vehicle, be inside the car, rev an engine, open doors, all without leaving their homes. Infinite possibilities were described by CEO and perceived by community through a series of events held by Portion to foster engagement.  For instance, the first-ever fashion line event originating in the Metaverse in collaboration with Portion and 3D visual artist Antoni Tudisco, the iconic designer Philipp Plein marked Milan Fashion week. Engaging activities like Parkour and Sunday Vibes selfies have been promoted among the community by action house Portion.  Iconic artists founded Museum of NFT Arts (MONA), designed as an open forum for the development of digital art aimed at encouraging and showcasing young NFT artists. There is no doubt such engaging events give the opportunity to connect with the Community, learn about the Metaverse &amp; have a chance to create or collect as part of the experience.  Portion is constantly allowing collaboration between talented artists in a variety of concepts including music.

"Hear me out, NFT’s are a great way nowadays to make a big buck, but at some point I just disconnect with the whole idea of these projects. The only people that win(in my personal opinion) are the people that mint a project(the early buyers). After that, whoever purchases the said nft only puts cash into the minters hand at which the buyer has to hope the project maintains popularity so he can find a buyer to obtain a profit and this becomes a never ending loop until nobody wants to purchase because the price is too high.

"People can change their social media profile picture to their newly purchased NFT, which is one of the main reasons Avatars NFTs have gone viral. It creates a massive networking effect on social media, which is the best place for it. Since Facebook and Whatsapp, people have used profile pictures to subtly express themselves.   The rising demand for NFT avatars has been fueled primarily by social media discussions about the new technology, as well as the exorbitant prices paid for them by private collectors and institutions.  While the market for NFT avatars is still small, many of the rarer NFTs from popular projects have seen a significant increase in secondary market value on NFT marketplaces like OpenSea, with some selling for hundreds of times their original mint price.  There's no denying that the market for NFT avatars is expanding, as evidenced by social media conversations and blockchain data. NFT projects, for example, are said to be to blame for an increase in Ethereum gas prices in August 2021.  But I don't think gas prices will be an issue in the future because many other projects, such as Solana, have jumped on the NFT bandwagon, and even if it didn't, you could make your own custom NFT avatars with ""NFT Avatar Maker,"" a tool for NFT creation. And I believe you can save a lot of money using these methods.  BUT, BUT, BUT.....  In industries such as gambling, art, crypto games, and many others, NFT avatars have been a huge success. The technology will continue to improve in terms of utility and features, adding functionality that will help the NFT market grow even more.

"So I started getting into NFT over the weekend and I have a small understanding of crypto.  I bought Ethereum a couple years ago because I liked its platform more than bitcoin and it was cheaper which was the big selling point.     So I saw this race car on OpenSea and it was connected to this racing game where you buy the NFT's and race them and the best times can win money.  I thought it sounded like a fun way to get into the NFT space with me being a gamer and the cars being dirt cheap compared to a lot of the meme art I see online.    I have a ton of questions cause I've wasted some money (which is fine...my own fault)     I created a Meta Mask Wallet and buy Ethereum on there.  I go to buy something on OpenSea and I thought I made a purchase of the vehicle but I guess all I did was transfer ETH from Meta Mask to Open Sea?  does that sound correct?    Then I bought another car and this time it worked and my Open Sea balance dropped so that confirms my first question I think.     I learn there is a Matic network and a polygon network?  what's that about?   how can I avoid these insnae gas fees?  and I need to turn it into REVV coins but idk how to do that so I can play the game.  im confused.    I guess my biggest question is how do I buy ETH, buy something off open sea and hopefully transfer it to USD later without losing 70% of my money making transactions?      I created a defi wallet through crypto dot com app.  should I use that?  is meta mask better?

"Millions of dollars are being spent on NFt avatars, some of which have no utility and are currently scarce, but I believe that when the metaverse arrives, everyone will have their own avatar in the form of NFTs, and the frenzy will be real. Metaverse will take blockchain-based video games and Web3 to new heights, bringing multiplayer games closer to reality. Anyone with a digital avatar can play immersive video games in the metaverse. Players can also earn rewards in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which will help the gaming economy grow.  One thing is certain: the metaverse will provide many opportunities for many people. However, I still do not believe you should purchase avatars for such a large sum of money. There are tools on the market that allow you to create your own custom NFT avatar for a very small fee. One such tool is called NFT avatar maker.  I'm curious if, with tools like these on the market, the scarcity of avatars will diminish as the metaverse and tools like these grow in popularity.",0.9847,0.023,0.8,0.177

"""Basically, it’s when people with low knowledge have the highest self-confidence when talking about something.  Take crypto for example, you’ll find it most often in small crypto circles that those who know absolutely jack s&amp;it will be the loudest and talking the most. Why is that?  It’s because most people who want to invest don’t want to do the work, they want the work done for them. They want someone to tell them: buy this buy that sell and make profit. Well it doesn’t work that way. Those who know, don’t need to coach you, and those who coach you know the least.   Fear those with the loudest mouths, they often have the shallowest pockets. Look at those rare talkers, that talk seldom but speak most eloquent and concise. Those will be the ones telling you good advice and pointing you at the right assets.   Thankfully, I am proud to say I have one of those friends, they rarly offer financial advice, but when they do it’s always gold. GOLD.

Recently, another DP member also announced that he would be accepting cryptocurrency donations . Representative Lee Kwang-jae mentioned that he would be accepting cryptocurrency donations in mid-January.  ""It is high time that we undertake innovative experiments to improve our understanding of these future technologies and change perceptions of digital currencies and NFTs,"" Lee wrote.

Hello guys :)  I'm looking into creating my own NFT collection on the Solana network with a game where you can use your NFTs as characters that you can move around and fight with in the game. At the moment I've just been doing a lot of research into how to go about doing this but it's hard to find all the relevant information online especially on the Solana network.   My question is how do I go about on doing this? I'd love if someone could break down in briefly the process I'd need to take to go about doing this or at least guide me in the right direction on what I would need to read up on.  A couple of questions I have in mind are:  \- Do I need to make a Smart Contract on Solana first and then I'd move onto creating the NFT artworks and the game?   \- Do I create the game and once it's done I implement it onto the blockchain or would I need to actually create the game on the blockchain?   \- Do I create the generative collection of PNG's of the NFTs and once they're done they should be ready to implement onto the blockchain?   \- What programs do I need to look into in order to do the various tasks that are necessary?  Any help at all would be greatly appreciated as I couldn't find much YouTube videos on this and my research on google just added to my confusion.,0.9851,0.023,0.84,0.137
"Language, technology and the ability to talk about his work, among the main challenges for those who enter crypto art  As crypto art and 'NFTs' take hold, so do consumer questions. To resolve some of these, LR spoke with Daniel Uricoechea, a Colombian photographer who has been in this market for more than a year and who has also dedicated himself to teaching other artists about the advantages and challenges of this new digital showcase.  How would you explain 'NFTs' for dummies?  The essential concept of the [development of non-fungible tokens](https://www.blockchainx.tech/non-fungible-token-development) (NFT) is based on Blockchain technology that allows unique identification of assets. This [NFT development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/non-fungible-token-development) can represent and be used for many things, one of which is crypto art.  So, they are digital assets that have a unique number within the Blockchain to which it belongs (there are different networks). And they can represent who the creative is, what they represent: a digital asset or a physical asset that can be tied to a work, for example.  What advantages are there for artists who enter this market?  First, access to the international market, with crypto art we speak of a global market, because it is online. It also allows creating a property towards the artist, in which there is a very important thing and that is that the royalties on the work will go to the artist forever, and he can determine the value of this royalty, normally it is 10% and every time the work is resold, that percentage will go to the creator, no matter what price it is resold.  What kind of art can enter?  There are different artistic expressions: visual artists, writers, musicians. The uses are endless and the potential for the use of technology is vast.  What challenges can artists encounter?  There are three important challenges: first, the lack of knowledge about the technology, investigating what the Blockchain network is, what cryptocurrencies are, what the security challenges are; second: the language, because the predominant language in the market is English and the skills to talk about oneself, one's own art and one's own context.  What are the main learnings from your NFT experience?  It's not about how to sell but how can I build a community. In the end you end up connecting with people who see your art and buy. The main channels of interaction are on Twitter, it is the native channel for the discussion of crypto art.  There are also other channels such as ClubHouse, where specific topics about projects and initiatives are discussed. Even Instagram, people keep showing their projects.  On the other side of the coin, what would be the recommendations for those who want to buy this type of art?  In general, there are two types of buyers: one, the art enthusiast, the collector, who identifies with the works and we also have the one who thinks the investment very well, has the purchasing power and buys with the aim of earning. So the first thing is to think which of the two I am.  And where can they start? on Twitter, start searching and go to the platforms, for example OpenSea, where many creatives start with their works. Also other markets such as KnownOrigin, Foundation or Super Rare. Find what kind of art they are looking for in the different marketplaces.  Accompanying other artists  In addition to promoting his own art on these platforms, the Cartagena artist also has an educational Podcast on the subject called 'NFT Outer Space show' available on all digital platforms. This initiative is carried out by the NFTartists Diana Pelenur, who is also a photographer, and Jimena BuenaVida, a visual artist.",0.9852,0.005,0.913,0.081
"Hey  guys, I'm new here, so please don't judge too tough if I picked the  wrong subreddit or did smth wrong. I know it could be not a new  question, so you could guide me to some resources or whatever, but I  wonder how could author defend property rights for his NFT.  For  example, artist created picture NFT and it's price is 10.000$, and  while picture is on market, it's pretty obvious how to distinguish which  is which. But imagine a platform that allow you to create virtual rooms  and attach your NFT there. So he created the room and fill it with  different NFTs include this one. And other guests on this platform could  leave feedbacks, likes or maybe even pay him for his room. So on that  platform scammer would create almost the same NFT (maybe will change  just a few pixels) and create the same room, so it would be really  difficult for guest to tell which one is the original one. It would be  still obvious on market, but for just ordinary players, who are not into  all this and just want to look at the virtual room, it would be hard to  distinguish them. And they could give glory (likes, payment,...) to  scammer. So I understand that actually it's not only NFT problem, but  perhaps you know some known solutions for this or have any thoughts.  Assuming that I'am the owner of that kind of platform, what should I do  to prevent it?  I appreciate any thoughts or ideas!",0.9852,0.044,0.793,0.163
"Hi everyone, I am a year 1 student who is currently studying Philosophy and Anthropology at Uni. I am now starting an experiment on NFTs because I am curious about the whole ecosystem. I wanted to know can an artist with no marketing team earn a living by creating NFTS and to have conclusions about my curiosity while selling NFTS like Can Artist actually earn money from it? Is NFTs a scam? Is it ""healthy"" for the world or even deeper questions about whether NFTs has a meaning to exist? or what is art?  I also believe in potential buyers like the person in front of the monitor reading this Reddit post can also invest in my NFTs to participate in this experiment/campaign within their needs.  I am here without any marketing team and I am here to sell NFTs because I am curious and I also like to create things and inspire. I want to prove that anyone could create and earn their livings(at least some). By setting my first NFTs with a really low price, there should be a chance for people who wants to start investing with not a lot of money to buy my NFTs. (Only if you could afford the gas fee and have beliefs on this campaign)   Here is how it works:  1. I will start by only selling 5 NFTs of ETH 0.02 with the titles of #SlightlyHigher 001  #SlightlyHigher 002  #SlightlyHigher 003  #SlightlyHigher 004 #SlightlyHigher 005  2. Once all the 5 NFTs are sold, I will start selling a random number of up to 10 NFTs at a slightly higher FIXED price. For example, 001-005 were sold with ETH 0.001 and I will start selling 006-008 with ETH 0.02 and so on.   3. Let's see how far could we go :)    Oh yeah and a little bit background on myself if you care  I grew up in Hong Kong and speak native Cantonese and fluent English (maybe), I migrated to Australia 6 months ago because of the political environment in Hong Kong. I was really a bad student back in Hong Kong where my GPA was 0 in my first year and I had no problem about being it as well. But my life actually changed 1 year ago after smoking the first joint in my life, I started to see the world from a whole different perspective and also stopped seeing things that only appeared on the surface and actually started to think what is the meaning of life. I found it so enjoyable when I started creating different kinds of things. (from creating this experiment to creating this post) So yeah, here I am.

The idea is to give the opportunity to costumers to create their squad and compete against others coach.   The matches are played according to the NBA calendar at each event you select your squad and the result of your match will be according to the real life players stats ex:    1pt = +1pt   1 assist = + 1pt   1 rebound = +1 pts   1 steal = +2pts   1 block = - 2pts for the opposing team.   1turnover = - 2pts for your team   by adding up the stats of all the players we determine the score of the match.   Teams will be ranked in different leagues based on their results and rewards will be awarded each season based on ranking.   In order to finish the game and make it amazing like i imagine  it i need a bit off extra money. That is why i create this NFT collection but i have 0 skills  in marketing or social growth my Instagram account have 70 followers XD so i need help any help.    https://opensea.io/master-coach   Thanx for your attention.

Yesterday, I just found out about the NFTs and what exactly are they and I was quite impressed with the amount of money people can make from them. So, I took my phone and gave it a try to draw it, because why not? I wanted to draw something kind of unique and weird. So after 30 minutes, my very first “Angry Squirrel” came out. And I really liked it. I found it kind of weird but at the same time, unique. My goal is of course, to make massive amounts of money, but  I want to have some fun too!

"$ETH, $SOL, $XTZ , or $MATIC?   I have been trying to keep a foot in all NFT platforms. It can be a pain sometimes learning new swapping exchanges, having multiple wallets and trying to keep all that straight and secure.  It feels like I am trying to be proficient in multiple languages, and in a lot of ways it probably is, very similar.  I really like learning and am trying to stay one step ahead of the curve just in case one of these emerging chains comes out of nowhere and starts gaining steam.   - -   NFT blockchains feel like different types of slot machines.  $ETH is in the high limit room. The projects have higher entry points and the financial upside is the greatest. It’s like playing the $5.00 slots with the pull handle and the 3 max lines. Functionally it works and if you hit payout is gonna be big. Doesn’t take much to figure out how to play but but the risk is greater. You take a couple zeros and you can get wiped out quick.   A step down in price is $SOL. More like a $1.00 slot. The graphics are better, there are multiple reels and the sound quality and speed are a bit faster. You can add your player card and track your stats. Still have big upside if you hit a jackpot but never gonna be as much as a high limit slot. You can play a bit more, have all the fun and minimize you exposure.  And then you have the penny slots, $MATIC,$XTZ. Same functionality or better  and can play with a little bag and a bit longer with out running out of cash. On the upside, you may get entered into a drawing or a progressive long term that could pay off big down the road.   You can gamble with all of them, get the same dopamine rush and experience and makes some money if you hit.     My recommendation if your new is to start with the penny slots, learn how to play and work your way up.",0.9858,0.023,0.855,0.123

(Added paragraph 13 of the platform's rules and guidelines for partners)  https://preview.redd.it/p5bh6fi6k7881.png?width=825&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6cad9b854e0fa8b2865fb20db6964e1ea2de33bf  In contrast, Steam's nearest competitor Epic Games has said it is ready to embrace blockchain: ""Epic Games is open for games that support cryptocurrency or blockchain-based assets.""  https://preview.redd.it/9hkhyle6k7881.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fa4aa5b4dc7319aa9b07f7209736d9844c3bac5  At this time, [Valve](https://hawk.live/posts/how-many-arcanas-in-dota-2-and-how-to-get-them-all) has not commented in any way, and is unlikely to speak publicly on the matter. Tim Sweeney, the founder of Epic Games, has indicated that they are still working on exactly how they will support NFT. After that, a lot of debate for and against the role of blockchain, NFT and cryptocurrencies in the future of eSports and gaming itself has sprung up.  ## What is the NFT?   NFT or non-fungible token - refer to unique blockchain-based digital tokens used to register and track ownership of digital assets such as images, video, text or audio.  https://preview.redd.it/plt4mx47k7881.png?width=310&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21df01da131f4b59836e0f8b65c24321a6a75662  NFT has become very popular over the past half year, with high-profile events such as Jack Dorsey selling his first tweet from Twitter as NFT for $2.9 million and digital artist Beeple selling his art collection as NFT for around $69 million.  https://preview.redd.it/epq9t9q7k7881.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f59048837da43289e988ee9384f5221bac632f44  In the eSports and gaming industry, NFT has positioned itself as a way of authenticating ownership of in-game skins, trophies, tournaments and highlights. In addition, NFT can provide for the purchase, sale and transfer of these items outside of the virtual gaming world and the gaming industry.   ## The case for NFT in cybersport and gaming  NFTs can enhance fan engagement in cyber sports, which can benefit players, teams, tournament organisers, spectators, publishers and other stakeholders. For example, NFTs can help justify in-game assets, purchases and achievements, thereby extending value beyond virtual game worlds.  https://preview.redd.it/jdr96ub8k7881.png?width=841&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8b4e83fe6d1bef750cc495d35434e6807db04fb  After all, many spectators and players want to get their hands on a unique item, just as in traditional sports, spectators can get an autographed ball or a player's jersey. In 2020, around 63% of players said they would spend more on virtual goods if they had real value and could be exchanged or sold.    Similarly, NFTs can help create formal structures around grey market gaming assets and memorable things to authenticate the ownership of such assets.  ## Arguments against NFT in cybersport and gaming  The cryptocurrency industry still faces challenges and is largely considered very risky for many companies. And because NFTs are a subset of cryptocurrencies and they are still very new, they are largely misunderstood and the hype around pricing has the media fixated on their speculative nature. It is therefore not surprising that many lawyers advise cybersport organisations to avoid cryptocurrencies and NFTs.  https://preview.redd.it/mfgqjgw8k7881.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6895583ee7e0f2f4ab8712954bf6833c10cd1b05  There is a legitimate concern that the merger of NFT with cybersports and gaming could expose the gaming community to scams, fraud and hacks. In the past, the developer who promoted the game Evolved Apes, which supposedly had a collection of 10,000 unique NFTs, turned out to be a scammer, disappearing with more than $2.7 million.   ## What can be a bridge between the world of eSports and the NFT  Justin Wenczka, CRO at Verasity, stated that their platform, at the protocol and product level, can enable decentralised solutions for the cyber sports industry. Verasity aims to offer a platform that will enhance the cyber sports experience with blockchain-based solutions, without forcing a revision of the existing legacy infrastructures on which the industry operates.   https://preview.redd.it/iombtzn9k7881.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72870e39ef69c6b3d710f785aa040276aa80c69e  To tackle scams, for example, Verasity has developed a blockchain-based anti-fraud solution that authenticates digital assets by recording data in an immutable, decentralised log.   Similarly, the Verasity solution can authenticate the authenticity of the seller or the market in which the in-game NFTs are placed. This ensures that the seller has the legal right to sell such assets and that the assets are genuine and match their description.  Justin Wenczka concluded with a comment:  &gt;We think that NFTs present an opportunity for esports to attract a new audience, and we will continue to empower the esports industry with the tools and technologies needed to leverage emerging decentralised technologies for sustainable growth.",0.9861,0.037,0.86,0.103
"I apparently missed the news that AnteFame, a p2e motorsport fantasy league, has collaborated with Maserati, to deliver real-world benefits to players! I was so excited to find out about this!  The collaboration is a step toward commemorating Maserati's rich motorsport legacy. In reality, Maserati has confirmed that it will join Formula E in 2023, following a 66-year absence. As I find out Maserati will be the first Italian manufacturer to compete in the all-electric world championship as a result of this move., can't wait for that!  As someone who is a big fan of motorsports and follows all the news related to it, it really amazes me how I just found out about this news that I don’t believe has passed unnoticed among people. So since I bring you old news, let me share some new ones with you lol. I'm following for some time the K4 rally racing team, especially since they have really great drivers, and now I hear that they've also released the KFT rally NFT p2e game which is actually the first blockchain rally game ever.  I notice that racing teams and motorsport, in general, are starting to use NFTs more and more and I am very glad about that because it seems to me that the sports industry is among the last to start including them in its business. What's your opinion on that, do you like the fact of using NFTs in motorsports?",0.9862,0.009,0.846,0.145
"Hi guys, I'm a photographer who is fortunate enough to be around a world class top of his sport athlete. And by top, I mean the current ""best"" in his sport. I have a never before seen or released photo of said athlete. And not a generic photo, but a unique one that is damn near iconic, but it's a moment that will never be repeated. A unique moment when another athlete made a visit and an amazing moment was captured from it.  I don't want to give specifics because I'm trying to get in contact with someone who could help me, and get a commission for doing so. I know close to nothing about NFTs. Except that I've seen some very high prices for very simple pieces of work, that outside of the NFT space have not much worth, without insulting anyone.   The photo I have has worth on it's own. And I know I could shop it around and get some decent money off of it, but thought that I would rather make it into a NFT. I believe this photo could fetch a lot of attention but I need the right connection and platform to do so, because I am a fairly private person myself and while I do have social media, my content reaches a lot of people organically, but my personal reach is fairly minimal. I know that with the right connection and guidance, this could be a lucrative NFT.  If anyone is interested in helping me out and like I said, getting commission off of helping me out. Please reach out to me. I also have quite a few other shots that are iconic shots that get used all the time on social media/websites for posts regarding said athlete. And a couple of other athletes. I would like to do something in the NFT realm with some of those as well. But the photo that I'm mostly talking about in the post is just that unique, that I would like to focus on that one first.",0.9863,0.026,0.842,0.132
"Apparently, there have been more registered games on blockchain for a while, and it's sad to see more than 70% of them keep using the same UI and choosing not to upgrade even with how well blockchain technology has advanced. We should be getting to the era where games like Soccer already have a blockchain version, and even starts to compete with the already exosting Pes or Fifa. or maybe any other games you think about while reading this.  Still left to the new devs we will have in coming months, as the only games we have to enjoy now are those pixelated but challenging games. The likes of cometh for example which i recently discovered and has surprised me, love the game cause it has stratergy involved even while it's not very advanced. If you don't believe me you can check the amount of people on the waiting list to have a tast of the game, more than 22,000 people.  if there's anyone already focusing on releasing a good UI game, please don't stop. You definitely will have me for one to keep playing the game as long as earning is involved, and of course will have more people stand to support blockchain gaming as compared to the games we play now and spend time on without getting something in return.",0.9863,0.02,0.813,0.167
"Hi All!  (Research and Analysis of this Bapetaverse NFT)    Bapetaverse  Supply:10,000  Confidence level: Very High  Twitter: [https://twitter.com/bapetaverse](https://twitter.com/bapetaverse)  Website: [https://bapetaverse.com/](https://bapetaverse.com/)    If Adams bomb squad (street wear brand) has 25k NFT and floor is 0.6 ETH this should put Bape at 1.5 ETH floor minimum if scaled to ratio by 1 to 2.5 because Bape only has 10k NFT.     Bapetaverse is a bigger street wear brand which should mean the NFT should be bought up to a floor minimum of 3 ETH.     Once Bape have it's metaverse it should bring the NFT value up to 5-7 ETH floor.    Depending on what other utility and demand for the Bapetaverse NFT we could easily see 7 - 10 ETH valuation.    Utility that will increase value of NFT:  \- NFT holders gets first dibs or raffled for Bathing Ape clothing new releases  \- NFT holders gets 10-20% off A Bathing ape wear  \- NFT holders gets invitation to special events  \- NFT holders gets airdropped Bape wear in the metaverse   \- NFT holders gets a bathing ape clothing - - NFT strong holders gets merchandise sent to their home address (Confirmed)    Now the below is speculation:  A Bathing Ape NFTs tagline is WGM (World Gone Mad)    WGM looks like WAGMI    WAGMI (We All going to Make it) is a huge thing in the crypto space. People will APE in because of this. This should bring the valuation of the NFT to 13 eth +    What I am going to mention next is hopium but not that outrageous. The Art of Bape is kind of like Clone X - by Nike. It is 3D and looks nice. This should also add additional value and bring the Bape NFT valuation up to 15 eth +     Ok now this is where I do my crazy speculation where Bapetaverse really catches eyes with Bored Ape Yacht Club and MAYC. Where people has missed the ride up of BAYC and MAYC and has found Bape NFT which is a 3D version of an APE with much nicer graphics design, backed by a well known street wear brand with a metaverse + utility! If this ever happens the NFT will be valued between 60 to 80 ETH     Already:    7 CryptoPunks owners is holding BAPE NFT  32 BAYC owners is holding BAPE NFT  108 MAYC owners  is holding BAPE NFT  108 CLONE X owners is holding BAPE NFT  50 Azuki  owners is holding BAPE NFT    Celebrities who bought BAPE NFT:  Michael Jordan's Son   Nav (Canadian rapper)   Chilam Cheung (HK actor)  Lee Zii Jia (professional badminton athelete)  Carlos ""Spiff TV"" Saurez   Alexandre Arnault (Europe's richest son)  Steve Aoki",0.9863,0.027,0.864,0.11

"I want to store my NFTs metadata and I want to use IPFS Deskstop.   In IPFS Deskstop.exe if I upload my PNGs and JSONs manually is it works well?   I don't want to use Pinata or another online service for this (because of the upload limit).   So I created 15000+ PNGs pictures with Ui Path Robot and the size of these pictures is about 140 GB, I think I use [nft.storage](https://nft.storage) but I don't know how to create a folder in there but in the [IPFS.io](https://IPFS.io) Deskstop .EXE I can create a Folder( for getting the folder CID like on Pinata) and this solves my problem easily.   Why do people don't use this method? Am I thinking wrong? Because maybe I don't know something (why nobody teaches this method on youtube nowadays), I'm new in this world so maybe yes.   All in all, with [IPFS.io](https://IPFS.io) Deskstop .EXE I create a folder for PNGs then I manually upload PNGs one by one then I create the JSONs and after that, I create another Folder and upload all JSONs one by one.   In my head after this process, I get the right ipfs CID for my folder that I will use in my smart contract. Is that working?  PS: Of course, I will not Upload one by one manually I Will use Ui Path robot for these. But all the information what I want to use in metadata is stored in an excel file. And this is a way easier way for me because I never code in Sol or JS.",0.9864,0.029,0.797,0.175

"In the last few years, the world of NFT has burst into the life of the planet and has begun to actively conquer the digital space. Now NFTs are getting deeper and deeper into our lives. One of the facets of reality where the NFT has firmly established itself is digital art. The creators of elements of contemporary art have begun to actively move online and create art masterpieces, using blockchain technology with might and main.  The first successes of digital contemporary art were narrow-minded, and not very clear to the general public works. But at that time the NFT was the world of only a small number of dedicated people. Now that the NFT has been widely developed and now every person can be a full-fledged player in this digital reality, digital art is beginning to embrace more and more fans from different genres and directions. Now there is a place for classicism, and realism, and impressionism. Moreover, the more classical directions of art, having found their embodiment in the NFT, have every chance to supplant surrealism and avant-gardism. Here, for example, the new collection ""Together V3"" on OpenSea - a bright creation of classical romanticism, dressed in a modern form of digital art to be accessible to the maximum number of connoisseurs.  With the further development of NFT in the future, we will undoubtedly encounter new unexpected solutions in art, and perhaps forgotten styles will gain a second wind.",0.9865,0.015,0.826,0.158
"Hello, I would appreciate your help!   I have a good friend who enjoys traveling as much as I do, we have visited several European countries and stayed in the finest hotels.     So, here's the thing: I'm not familiar with cryptocurrencies or NFTs, they were completely new to me until a month ago, I'd heard about them but didn't know anything particular.   While my friend is quite familiar with all of this, and I recently discovered that he has even invested in some tokens or NFTs, as you can see, I'm not even sure about this one too.     He presented me to the idea of NFT a little better, and I agree, it seems quite appealing. What I'm not sure about, and what I'm referring to is that my friend proposed that we invest in the NFTs which could be beneficial to us later when we travel, for example, we could stay in some luxurious hotels, dine in fancy restaurants, and so on.     According to what I discovered on the internet, the hotel business has not yet fully joined this sphere, but it is planned for this year. So I'm wondering whether you'd invest in anything like that and if you have any suggestions for me as a newbie in all of this.     Of all the proposals we've got, we liked one NFT platform the most, a new NFT project called Last Hopium which offers one of the benefits of staying in the most famous hotels such as the Ritz, Plaza, Hilton, Waldorf, and so on.

This is so much fun to be honest, you never know which NFT will exceed your expectations. Look for a project in detail, check the devs, team, marketing behind it, demand in the community and a lot of other factors too. Keep practicing and eventually you will be able to make good profit out of your total trade. Some of the hot ones right now are [polyverse art by Idriss B.](https://polyverseart.io) who is worldwide know for his beautiful real polygonal artform that is selling like hot cakes right now with about 5-10 left for the phase one after which floor price is only going to go up from here and [cryptoland](https://cryptoland.is/) which is amazing metaverse based project. My true advice is, I don't promote any strategy or bots to detect the best NFTs for you because what may work for me or some part of the community does not guarantee to be a working formula for all.

"Well, here I am. I'm new to Reddit and NFTs and everything else but I just wanted to give it a shot. You may see my one appearance on similar subs making every attempt to determine whether or not there's anyone out there that might have the slightest interest, so I beg you to please disregard the spam (or if this is the incorrect location to post).  Basically, I wanted to create a collection of NFTs with a goal of promoting something that I feel we could use a little more of in our busy lives: rest and relaxation. This is rather vague, but I felt that I had an almost-decent concept in mind, as I feel that few activities help me to achieve this state of mind more than jigsaw puzzles.  Meet ""Puzzle Peace."" - An idea as old as time, being a small collection of 100 puzzle pieces that can be used to recreate the original image. I set myself the goal of incorporating a small ""twist"" to existing ideas in order to make my project a bit more unique and worthwhile, such as having the entire puzzle visible in each NFT, but with the applicable piece displaying the image while the locked pieces are ""greyed out,"" more-or-less. If, by any chance, you would like to know more, or if my less-than-adequate explanation only raised more questions, you can find me at any time through the marketplace URL listed below:  [https://opensea.io/collection/puzzlepeace](https://opensea.io/collection/puzzlepeace)   If you're still reading this, I must seriously commend you and thank you for your time! &lt;3  fern177",0.9868,0.034,0.814,0.152
"Hello everyone,  We are proud to announce the World’s first Passive income NFT collection – MetaSimps NFTs. An extraordinary, unique, and innovative concept of 9,999 NFTs’. This collection is created by five individuals, who are well-experienced in this known industry.  The project is quite advanced, based on Ethereum blockchain, and backed by the major holders of famously known CryptoPunks.  The developers of the MetaSimps NFTs have also planned to roll out the Simps Token to support and boost the MetaSimps NFT community. This initiative will enable the community to cross-sell and create value for both projects.  The rewards are generous, such as;  \- USD 50K giveaway to 20 NFT holders,  \- 10 Simps tokens per NFT per day to all holders,  \- 10% ETH generated from NFT sales will be added to liquidity,  \- Listing on CMC and CoinGecko,  \- And not to forget surprise giveaways.  A quick boost to 20x is very feasible due to cross-selling initiatives and more value creation is anticipated in the long term.  So, get ready to grab your spot in the Whitelist minting on 22nd Jan at 2 pm GMT before it is too late.",0.9868,0.009,0.797,0.194
"Hello all. We’ve been working on this project for some time now and it’s come the point where community feedback is needed. Please read the description and give us some thoughts on what you think of the overall concept/improvements/etc. Thanks ~  —  Alpha Quest is a unique project that centers around YOU and your interaction with both physical and virtual communities. We provide a variety of cards that reveal a real-life ‘Quest’ that must be completed in order to obtain the reward - Alpha Quest Token(s).   Quests are meant to be fun and can be explorative. Some will require you to communicate/interact with strangers, others will have you involved with your community or solving a riddle. We encourage completing these with friends, as it will make the experience more meaningful.There will be 5500 cards for our first season - Series 1 - with four different rarities: Common, Uncommon, Rare &amp; Legendary. The higher the rarity, the more difficult the task will be to complete. Similarly, completing more difficult tasks will yield more Alpha Quest Tokens for redeeming. Once the quest has been completed, users will get verified so token rewards can be airdropped directly to their wallets. You can keep the card as a collectible, or sell/transfer them to others in the community to try as well.  Holding one token alone will grant access to special chat communities, our metaverse hub, voting ability, early access to future releases, and more. Collecting tokens will allow you to climb the Token Leaderboard, which at the end of the season, will reward 10 ETH to the person with the most. There will be a certain amount of tokens available from the start, so be sure to get them while you can.  —  More info below:  [Quest Card Photos](https://i.imgur.com/rGbqCMO.jpg)  [Our Website](https://www.alphaquestnft.com)  [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/AlphaQuestNFT)",0.9869,0.024,0.837,0.139
"Hi Guys, I was really curious, is there any way to see like, the best NFT wallets that aren't just super big influencers with loads of cash. What I would be interested in is, does someone know of an account, that I can follow, that has had a LOT of success with minting? My strategy for NFT's is to get in on as many ground-floor hyped projects as I can, thinking that the winners will pay for the losers, but I want to mitigate risk, and personally, I know I am not the best at deciphiring the winners, and was hoping there was a way to follow big traders, or smart accounts, that are not just you know the typical Gary Vee or Logan Paul advice. People who have their ear to the underground, who have a track record of getting into awesome projects on the mint level. Thanks!",0.9869,0.048,0.714,0.239
"NFTs aren't going anyway, with the pass of time, every sector and brand will have an NFT plan in place to reach out to global consumers, but the industry that consumes NFTs the most is definitely the music industry and in my opinion, they will be the first in line for the number of NFT tickets they have sold, at least in the beginning, until this whole story about NFT tickets heats up, as you can assume there will be tickets for concerts, festivals, etc.     In the music business, NFTs may provide musicians with a fresh voice and assist them in connecting with their fan bases. Artists may create NFT songs and other collectibles that fans can buy on a marketplace, artists would also be paid royalties for every sale.     They can also help to handle secondary market issues and ensure that tickets are distributed fairly. We'll need systems like Centaurify for ticket minting and market functionality to make this a reality. With more artists and organizers on board, the music ticketing market will experience a major shift.     I’ve seen here several times that people ask what’s the thing with music NFTs, I hope I’ve pointed out to you some of the benefits of “music” NFTs.",0.9869,0.0,0.841,0.159

"Hello there. I'm new here so I'm not sure how this subreddit works exactly but I've just recently learnt about NFTs and their value in the future. Could someone explain to me how they work in greater depth for the following:  1. Why are NFT images worth so much and why are people paying for them exactly? (what's attracting these people basically), 2. How are NFTs created, from making the NFT image to getting it out there and sold? 3. Can anything be an NFT, for example games, software, music, etc... 4. How does one start making an NFT. I have understood that knowing how to code will help generate them automatically, but what about hosting the NFT on a server. How does someone pay for it? And how is it ensured that no one can copy it or re-create it themselves without me or the creator of the NFT knowing?  I hope these aren't too many questions, but I'm really curious about how it works and it's the first time I've ever gone into learning about blockchains and crypto, so this would really be insightful. Thanks in advance and have an amazing day!",0.987,0.027,0.806,0.167
"Hi all,  I'm in the early stages of an NFT project I'm working on and I'm just after some advice on the best ways to share profit back with holders? I understand usually a project will have their own token that they reward for staking or for other reasons etc but that usually has value because it (generally) has utility in their world/project.  I don't have any need for a token in my project, so it won't have any value if I just give them eg XYZ coin. Without going into detail any profit made in this project (if somewhat successful of course) will be in the ""real world"" in fiat money, I plan to pay a quarterly payout to holders. Would it just need to be as simple a process of transfering real money back into Eth for example and paying it out to each holding wallet, is there other methods of doing this? Preferably something that won't be hit by as many fees if by any chance it does get off the ground and become succsesful!  Any suggestions, or things I should look into/research, would be much appreciated! Cheers",0.987,0.008,0.821,0.171
"TW for the easily annoyed at confusing naive questions :)  You know how you see someone on tiktok or some social media site and they’re like “I made $ on my first NFT!” And they’re not artists or creators even, they just seem to have tried it on a whim and had some success?  Whenever I follow people who are actively trying to get into creating and selling NFTS they all say how they wish they had done xyz and before you get into it you should try xyz…  How important is it really to have a following or get to know people who make NFTs? I mean what if I make some really cool art with some strong concept, Is it enough? I currently have pieces that I’d like to try to sell but I’m hesitant to try without that following/understanding the marker—despite seeing so many people just “give it a shot” and actually sell their work. I’ve read that NFTs are finally a way to oppose the “broke artists” stereotype, in other words, artists finally have a chance in this new and exciting marketplace—but is it actually exactly like how the real art world already is—that you need the following, the it-girl/boy aesthetic, etc? Or is it probable or possible to get lucky without that all?   Also—while we’re here, can someone explain to me how NFTs got started, surely there’s some luck in there for the most popular NFT creators?",0.987,0.038,0.785,0.176

"**When everyone thinks about NFTs they think silly digital pictures that having ownership of is pointless.**  My brother and I have been thinking of better ways to incorporate NFT technology into business and investing because it’s a great tech, just bad current application. We want to bring in a new frontier of NFTs that focus on utility rather than just pointless digital images and really explore what NFTs can offer.  **We have created the idea of an NFT hedge fund.**  The hedge fund is owned by a company, and that company is split into shares/stakes which one NFT represents. One NFT = One Stake. The company is to have, say, 10k shares/stakes which are represented by 10k NFTs, and these NFTs are used to vote on the actions of the business. Votes will be cast on things like where to invest and when to sell assets such as crypto, stocks, property etc.  Investment profits will then be either distributed back to holders of the NFTs or reinvested pending on voting outcomes.  My brother - a fully qualified solicitor &amp; barrister High Court of NZ who has worked on a couple of previous crypto projects, has been diving into the legalities behind what we are planning on doing and if it is in fact possible without running into trouble with the law.  One thing we don’t want is this project to be classed as a security due to legal implications, costs, and onerous paperwork requirements restricting the project's progression.  We have found a way to do so, although we’re safeguarding our method currently to stop other projects getting the jump on us.  Another must is the payouts from the project must be in either ETH or BTC (bonafide non-securities) as they have the volume, even in bear markets, to cash out to fiat if required. Creating a ‘token’ for this project (or any NFT project for that matter) we believe is pointless as a large crypto bear market will wipe out these created token’s volumes making them essentially worthless/pointless.   Also no one wants thousands of different tokens in their wallet which they constantly have to convert to ETH/BTC - it’s just a pain in the ass.  **For those of you thinking “why don’t I just invest myself?”**  We’ve thought about this too. Royalties from resales of the NFTs will be continuously added to the fund, so the fund will always have a passive income. These added royalties will essentially grow your initial investment further with no cost to you. Even if one NFT is resold, the added funds from the royalties will mean you are better off.  Your position in this new-age hedge fund is also monetised for your benefit. An outsider can entice you to part with your right to investment profits by making an offer on your NFT using OpenSea/Rarible etc; accepting this offer will effectively “cash you out”.  **Other benefits.**  We also plan to offer other perks for our holders, for example credit platinum cards, event tickets (eg PGA Tour, Tomorrowland, etc), timeshares for holders, IRL meetups (eg F1 corporate box) and other perks which will make your NFT share double as a membership.  Finally, **100% of the proceeds from mint will be invested back into the project/company** to really get the ball rolling - no “founders’ fees”. We’ve been sick of hearing about all these scams or developers taking off with millions of dollars and bailing on projects, which is frankly gross and karma always catches up.  **A bit of background on us for those interested**.  I have a degree in architecture and have built websites, logos and done a ton of 3D modelling. My brother, like I said, is a qualified solicitor &amp; barrister of the High Court of NZ, has a degree in commerce, and has worked on previous crypto projects giving legal advice. Together we own a cocktail bar, small medical supplies company, are part of a property portfolio, and have been investing in gold, collectable cars, crypto, and stocks for over 10 years. We are both very business savvy, focused, and are constantly looking for new angles in business.

"""    Yes, the market is crashing. Everything is falling down. The whole market could fail, I know it is most probable that it would not fail, but it could. Even if it did that technology goes on. We have already seen examples of this, the world is starting to use blockchain technology in its multiple use cases, not just to trade and sell bitcoins.   That technology involved in this has come a long way and cannot go back. This is the point of no return. The tech has led us here and will continue to with us further. We have already seen examples of it, we have already seen how blockchain technology has been used to promote for examples: voting systems or for example ownership claims. And blockchain technology has witnessed a recent boom in its popularity.   Many users have been using it to promote their art and ensure the ownership of it. For example the royal Falcons club has taken this one step further making sure that each user not only gets to own his own special edition of a randomly generated non-fungible token, but he also gets special reward based upon it. This is the term why the special diet used that come included on the nft themselves, these strategies could be bought and sold just like to nft itself.  The technology created by this all will not go back, but went instead continue to develop.""",0.9872,0.032,0.815,0.153
"I remember when NFT was initially the most popular in the field of arts and then it seems to me overnight that hype spread to all possible industries, at first, I could not figure out when someone is releasing which NFT collection. Tbh as someone who is a big football fan, my favorite thing is that sport has included NFTs in its business.     And now it's hard for me to catch all those football NFT collections, and I see that new projects and trading platforms appear every month, all this has become very popular and I see that there are more and more of us users. These are some of the coolest projects I've found recently:     A new NFT portal for football fans, Golden Goals from France, has been up and running for a few months, three clubs from the French First Division are already partners there and offer NFTs diligently.       Then there's K-Club NFT, which is one of my favorite projects since it allows NFT holders to decide on the club's and its players' future. You may get up face to face with the club's administration while profiting directly from the surplus budget. To ensure the club's long-term viability, they have pledged to reinvest at least 80% of all NFT revenues.     Let's not forget the first mover for digital football trading cards is Sorare from France, which already offers trading cards of the respective players from more than 150 clubs!

What exactly is Gala?  Gala is an all new social media platform strictly for NFTs. Discover new NFTs, share your own, like and comment on the ones you love, and follow your friends and favorite collections.    How does it differ from other social media platforms?  While you may see a growing trend of people posting their NFTs on existing social media platforms, there are a couple problems with this. These platforms are often filled with a large amount of other non-NFT content you have to sift around. Gala is specifically tailored for sharing NFT content and upcoming NFT projects only. Gala unlike other social media is also directly integrated into the blockchain to be able to grab NFT assets automatically and post them.     We are currently dev complete and in the process of getting approval for Apple and Google Play stores. Supporting both Ethereum and Solana NFTs, more info can be found here:   [https://galamobile.io](https://galamobile.io)     Some feedback from the NFT community would be great! Thank you all for your time.",0.9873,0.013,0.803,0.184

"I'm a big fan of NFTs, but have not delved into it yet due to financial issues.  My dad has dementia and I'm trying to figure out ways to pay for his care.    An idea that was suggested to me was to come up with an NFT project (1,000 or up to 5,000) unique NFTs. I would envision the project aimed at three things:  * Raise awareness for dementia screening * Raise money for my dad's care and the care for two other people who I know have dementia * Donate any royalty money to dementia-related non-profits  However, I'd like to know your opinions.  That way, if you don't think it is a doable project for a newbie, I'll focus my efforts for his care on something else.  Don't know what yet, but something.    ***I appreciate all your honest opinions and advice.***   (BTW, I am not expecting tons of money even if I could get this done, but anything is helpful at this point.)",0.9874,0.009,0.803,0.188

This movement is inspired by the transformation that Medellín had thanks to reggaeton, where the drug culture was changed for the music culture, especially urban music. Cryptoperreo debuted on web 3 with a reggaeton song that talks about web 3, NFTS, and crypto, and with an art work highlighting various media celebrities who have helped build web3.  Alex and I want art to be decentralized, here ""perreo"" is decentralized, that's why we are betting on this project that aims to empower reggaeton actors, a Latin genre that has become very popular in the global music industry. We wanted to do this first job, as a love letter to the crypto community... this is just a preview of what this movement will be.

"Our team has long been exploring the NFT world for an opportunity to create something valuable. And consequently, an idea was born to move forward with a concept of time. In the real world, you can buy whatever you want, but time.  But the NFT world is where the impossible becomes possible. That is why our project, VR, is excited to give you a chance to buy time.  So we are going to start with the hours - exactly with 23 hours. An hour will be the most valuable unit, as there are only 24 hours. Since we are the first to endorse the project, we count on your support. And as the pioneers we are an original, and an original is always more valuable than a copy.

I’m reading about projects like ENGN working on introducing popular games we’re used to playing into the NFT universe. However, projects like this one seem to be a rarity.  Right now it just looks like most gaming companies aren’t really interested in improving gaming mechanics and graphics and are focusing mostly on profit generating.  This is arguably good for the short term but is really bad for the long term cause profits alone aren’t enough to convince gamers to switch from regular gaming to NFT gaming.

"I am torn about NFTs. I understand the value that stems from the technology and even from some of the artistic projects, but I also think that some NFT projects are stupid and sometimes really don’t have much value.   Im familiar with the NEAR ecosystem, and believe in crypto, but I am on the fence about some new projects that create fractionalized NFTs. I know Niftex does this and has had some success, but I just cannot see something like this catching mainstream approval.   The project Im talking about specifically is DEIP which is trying to monetize like all intellectual property and give it value by minting it as an NFT. I think this makes some sense in the areas of art and games, but I don’t understand why or how it makes sense to commodify really anything else.   Can someone explain to me the value of fractionalized NFTs, how they add value and why they are a good idea? I would love to have some discussion about any projects anyone is familiar with and try to get a better grasp on the utility of NFTs.",0.9877,0.053,0.742,0.205

Non-Fungible Tokens has opened many doors for individuals and companies especially for art related projects to help them create an audience and make the most of it. Crypto Investor Matt Allen has already taken it upon himself to use NFT to his advantage.   Matt has found that many corporations and individuals lack the experience and means to create meaningful, impactful, and lasting investments in the crypto market. Born as  Matthew Allen has his roots from the gulf coast area, is shaking up the NFT Amd crypto market  Matt has been able to quickly establish himself as one of the premier crypto and NFT investors with his advanced technical analysis to analyze the bearish or bullish movements of top performing crypto coins and tokens. While many traditional investors focus on spammy videos and forums to identify the desired crypto and NFTs, Matt has taken a different approach.   He shares that “I like to focus on building a reputation, direction, credibility, and appeal first for crypto and NFTs. Then, and only then, do I suggest funneling them to their way.” After establishing himself as a crypto investor, Matt decided to branch out into other mediums in order to strengthen his repertoire as a investor and this is when he started making investments in NFTs. He is a known speaker and author, he has been able to build a following for himself.  Matt now will be coming out with new NFT's and a game/token that will establish him online in a multitude of ways. Helping his clients to gain profits on his investments and much more, Matt has garnered every resource necessary to build the investment of his clientele. Anyone can reach out to him on Winwithnft.com or Designmynft.Com  As the Crypto and NFts continues to evolve it is clear that it will require initiative and hard work from those who wish to stay on top. One thing is for sure, however the space changes, it is certain that Matthew Allen will be there, leading the charge.",0.9878,0.02,0.857,0.123

"sorry if this is a dumb question but i need to know the SAFEST way possible. What i was thinking of doing is just hodling everything on my ledger (NFTs ETH and some other coins) and connect it to NOTHING at all. Then create a MetaMask account dedicated to buying/minting NFTs and create another MetaMask account dedicated to selling. So far from everything i’ve read and seen, this sounds like a safe bet.

"I came across an article that briefly explained why the Ken Kutaragi, the inventor of Playstation thinks the metaverse is of no value.  It mostly revolves around “why buy something that isn’t tangible” kind of narrative.  I mean technically arent skins on games like Fortnite and CSGO  intangible but still cost money? A lot of these skins are valued in the thousands of dollar some even reaching hundreds of thousands. So why didnt he speak about that?  I hope this doesn’t drive away developers or make them less enthusiastic about joining the NFT universe.  We’re already seeing some projects like Citrus heavily improving the NFT gaming and GameFi experience and it would be great if we saw more developers contributing as well. It would definitely speed up adoption.",0.988,0.011,0.747,0.243
"""  This is popular and common wisdom, that the best way to secure your portfolio is to ensure diversity and make it as absolutely colorful as you possible can. And honestly, I agree. I have got myself a bit of everything, some massive projects like BTC itself, ETH, ADA and even some tiny projects like Royal Falcons Club. The only thing all of these have in common, is that no matter their size, I believe in their success and roi in the future.   I know that one day I will be rich off of just owning these projects. Doesn’t matter to me where I bought them only that I did, and held. I know that these prospects are powerful, because they fit my models. And you too, should secure yourself with diversity, with projects that fit your models.   Don’t keep all of your eggs in one basket. Make sure your portfolio is diversified and well spread out. Evened out from all its side and you have a sliver of everything. You want to win the end, but more importantly, you must not lose.

""" I’m shocked that this even comes as a surprise to some people out here. They think that investing and trading is mostly about drawing chart and cashing out. Well, it isn’t. The reality is, the majority of great people in the market are spending their time researching and studying, and if you’re not, you should.   This is hard work. I won’t beat around the bush. This is time and effort and research will exhaust you. But it is the fact of the matter that you have to study in order to succeed.   If you haven’t already, you should put in more time studying new tokens and brand projects. Projects that are still under the radar and not being pushed by your local celebrity every day on Twitter.

They offer rewards simply for ownership and it is unique in their own right. Take a look at it it might interest you. Or maybe even look at other projects on the blockchain. The way I like to do it is I take suggestions from let’s say Reddit or YouTube or whatever, and then spend my time on my own research the validity of the claims.   Never take things as they are. Take suggestions with a grain of salt and put in the time and work to research it yourself. This is not new and insane advice by any regard, but it is a tip most of you need apparently.

"Crypto is a vaccine against inflation   (NFTs are a booster)  The inflation rate is disgusting. Its a nasty virus. Every day that money sits in a bank account, that virus(inflation) is sucking life(spending power) out of your money.  Last century, the best defense against that virus was to invest into things gold, land, and art. All things that appreciate in value faster than the decline of the inflation rate.  Gold, land, and art are all still solid store of value. Ill even say everyone should have some of each.   However unlike last century, we now also have a digital world. The virus of inflation can be counteracted ao much more effectively. Bitcoin and Digital land values are out pacing their real world counter parts at a growing rate  NFTs not only store value in a way similar to fine art, but some offer utilities as well. Things like royalties or use cases in games provide owners passive income with their stores of value. Not only that, some NFTs( like [macigeden.io/marketplace/SoLads](https://macigeden.io/marketplace/SoLads) ) bridge the gap between the metaverse and the physical world by offering real world benefits to holders.

"I had no idea that Belgian football club KMSK Deinze had formed a strategic agreement with the worldwide GameFi platform Digital Entertainment Asset until yesterday. It's amazing how quickly sports is incorporating all of this new technology into its business.     As I've realized he initiatives will include the purchasing of NFTs, digital assets, and game items on DEA’s PlayMining gaming platform. I even love more the idea that the club will also begin participating in DEA’s P2E games where revenue will be generated from investing in and organizing NFTs for P2E games! I'm super excited to see how will that go!     As NFTs continue to grow across industries (but there are still many who laugh at us), it is to no surprise for me personally that the digital asset has begun making headway in an array of different sporting contexts, none more so that the biggest moneymaker of them all, football.      There are multiple 2022 occurrences that can readily back-up up this statement, such as the construction of the Etihad stadium in the metaverse, the signing of a sponsorship deal between Tezos and Manchester United, or participating in major club and board decisions as an NFT holder, just like club owners, presidents, and managers do thanks to the K-Club NFT, and then there's the Premier League NFT license auctioning.

Rendering took more than 8 days and was a long,  non-duplicatable process that was unique to this image at the time. This  is as close to a unique antique NFT that you'll likely get! The file  uploaded to mint this NFT was directly copied from the CD I burned in  1997. I’m surprised the CD was even readable…  Why is  this actually scarce/rare and worth actually being a NFT?? 1) This is a one-of-a-kind image, done with a one-of-a-kind process, on  hardware and software that you'd be hard pressed to find today in  working condition. 2) I am the original author and this image has not been sold or used  elsewhere  How I did it: After playing with Bryce and Poser for a while and using on other  projects, I was inspired to create this metaphoric landscape. While done  in 1997, the image of a coil of earth/nature holding our mortal body  hostage still resonates today in the current environment. I set out to make this project be both beautiful and to stress the  technology of the day to the limit. I used the highest settings possible  for fidelity on the hardware in Bryce and slowly worked my process into  the scene pictured now. I then set my sights on creating and getting a  model exported from Poser and importing into Bryce. There was no direct  import path at the time, so a basic DXF file format was my only option. I  had to play with the export settings to find a format/model that would  properly import into Bryce.  Many attempts did not import properly and had many artifacts up to and  including complete corruption of the file, crashing Bryce (sometimes  rendering the file unusable – luckily I was creating copies). Texturing  and materials were then applied to the figures in Bryce once imported  and placed. After many rounds of tweaking the settings and low-quality  test renders, I tried to find the upper limit that Bryce would render on  the hardware I had access to. The final successful render ran for more  than 8 tense days of checking progress and hoping it would finish  without crashing. It was about a week of work just to find settings that  would actually render without crashing before a successful render was  achieved!  I was more than proud when this finished and went into my physical  portfolio for a while before being stored until now.",0.9883,0.021,0.87,0.109

"the title isn't meant to say that being successful in the space is easy, but rather that the success people see on the ethereum blockchain seems nearly impossible on polygon.   maybe i could get some people's thoughts on this because i havent fully come to an understanding on why this is the case. i understand polygon has been on the come up for the past year, and the ethereum network was the way to go in past years, but it almost seems blatantly obvious that polygon is better now, is there something i'm missing? i'm not a developer so this very well could be the case, maybe there are some challenges that polygon faces while developing certain contracts, but from what i know, there's really no difference. so why are people drawn to the ethereum network, i mean, is there a gas kink or something?     i've recently looked into starting a collection, art is in the works and i want to do everything right, but some of the questions i can't seem to overcome just simply come from the idea of minting and how to go about that successfully on polygon. i'll explain what i mean with an example. recently ive been pretty active in communities on polygon. a few days ago, one of the communities im active in made an announcement about a new drop, and the price per mint would be .015 wETH. there we're some people in the chat that we're almost fuming. mind you this community has almost 15k on twitter and 5k in another social media chatting app (why do yall ban that word? xD) and its been a long road to get there.      anyways, what im getting at is, every day i see projects blow up on ethereum, but hardly ever on polygon. polygon gas is a fraction of what you see people pay on ethereum, so why is it so hard to have success on polygon? why are people willing to pay $300 to mint and $150 on gas on ethereum, while others complain about a project that is virtually the exact same on polygon when it goes for anything over $50 and like $2 max for gas?      i guess ultimately im in a dilemma because i feel like going all out on a project and putting it on polygon is just not going to see the success one would see on ethereum. guess i just gots to see it through     i'd love to hear some people's thoughts on all of this.",0.9885,0.063,0.804,0.133
"    The crypto space is ever expanding &amp; growing with interesting developments on either each protocol or ecosystem, and It’s no news that the buzzwords in the space over the past 6 months include NFTs, alongside Web3 &amp; Metaverse  Unfortunately, what captured the public’s attention when it comes to NFTs are these regular PFP’s selling for crazy figures on the leading NFT marketplaces. And I think it’s highly unlikely that this would be a lasting trend.  Looking beyond the hype these ‘JPEGs’ brought, are diverse use cases for Non-Fungible Tokens in the space. And these are not limited to; Gaming, Real Estate ownership, Ticketing, Metaverse, Inventory, Music &amp; many other possibilities.  I believe NFTs will revolutionize these areas of applications, and even make ownership seamless &amp; the process to prove them. Stumbled recently on a post in one of the sub-reddit detailing how GET Protocol via its technology unlock the benefits of Digital NFT blockchain ticketing.  Another great novel concept brings NFTs to DeFi, opening up the possibility of NFT staking/farming- where these digital assets can be staked to a protocol for earning yield. Onessus provides this opportunity.  In the metaverse; a potential $8 Trillion opportunity (according to Goldman Sachs) ,NFTs will define access. It will be one’s identity to gain entrance to either a conference, meeting or any other important event. Platforms like Dreem Metaverse is already leveraging on this utility through its character NFTs, which allows access to its existing realms.  These realms are like marketplace website where there are things in them that cost money. For example, if a realm has a cinema in it, people that have a certain NFT can gain entry. This could even be rented out from the owner for certain period of time, for a payment.  The interest in NFTs is undoubtedly heating up &amp; growing, with companies like Coca-Cola &amp; Nintendo getting in. I think it’s a matter of time before some of these real use cases &amp; adoption go mainstream and supersede the current hype.",0.9885,0.02,0.84,0.14

"Hey guys, I would love to hear your thoughts on sports NFTs marketplaces and platforms? Would you invest in some sports NFT collection?      NFT becomes more than a digital asset, it will bring together fans of the world's greatest sport in a way that has never been done before, don't you think? With a help of NFTs, they think that they could bring football clubs ownership back to the way it was intended to be – owned by a community.     I enjoy how there are a variety of options available on sports NFT platforms, ranging from trading cards and NFT collections to digital films. What do you enjoy the most, and how do you believe all of this will affect sports?     Which sport are you most interested in and which athlete's NFT collection would you like to buy?     I have always been most attracted to football as a sport, I have even been involved in it for many years, so it was logical for me to look for a football NFT marketplace.     I had the opportunity to come across a real marketplace for football enthusiasts called First Eleven, it has everything I need at the moment, I really like it.    Do you have any other suggestions for me?",0.9887,0.0,0.828,0.172

"Greetings! I would like to share the first artwork I've come up with. I am planning to make a collection of rarest gemstones themes for my abstract painting. Please visit the link and share this with the people whom you know that are art enthusiastic. I'd like to know your thoughts about it :))  How did I come up with this theme?  Foremost, gemstone just entered my mind cause I'm really fond of them. I see myself as a gemstone. I did some research and based on Australian Museum ""gemstones are a product of the earth. Some, like diamond and zircon, were formed deep in the earth and brought to the surface by explosions of molten rock. Many, like topaz, tourmaline and aquamarine, crystallized slowly from hot fluids and gases as they cooled and solidified, far below the surface of the earth. Others formed from liquids filtered into cracks and pockets in rock, like Australian opal. Some, like garnet and jade, formed when rocks were heated and pressurized by earth movements, and recombined to form new, different minerals.""  In this pandemic, life has been pressuring and really tryna bring us down but as the forces of life crystalize us, we are turning into beautiful rare gemstones.  Thank you for reading and please support me in my journey as I took my infant steps in NFT and Artist field! God bless us all &lt;33",0.9887,0.007,0.809,0.184
"Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are poised to become ""critical pieces of sports technology infrastructure,"" PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), a multinational professional services network that offers investment services , said in its latest report . Commercial advice.  Entitled 'Sports Outlook 2022', the report dives into the potential of NFTs within the sports industry, arguing that digital assets are among the top ten trends shaping the future of sports.  NFTs, which are unique and non-exchangeable digital assets stored on a blockchain, have created an element of scarcity in the digital world for the first time in internet history, according to the report, which points to at least three use cases of NFTs. these assets.  The most widespread application area for digital assets is in collectibles. For decades trading cards have been popular and have indeed become big business. Similarly, PwC hopes that collectible NFTs will become the digital version of trading cards.  *""Think of traditional memorabilia: The highest-scoring NBA player's paper ticket recently sold for nearly half a million dollars,"" the report says. ""For the next generation, maybe a digital check is authenticated and features some exclusive content. Would someone pay \[$\]1 million for it?""*  The report also mentions that Dapper Labs' NBA Top Shot has already proven this. NBA Top Shot is an NFT marketplace where fans can buy, sell, and trade NBA moments that are built into an NFT. As of the end of March 2021, the marketplace had made around $500 million in sales with more than 800,000 accounts.  The second big use case for digital assets is seen to be NFTs for Season Ticket Members (STMs), which could provide holders with tokenized passes and enhance the experience of a club's loyal fans.  *“This could include special VIP venue areas, concession stand discounts or other traditional season ticket benefits, with full confidence in their authenticity,” PwC said, adding that STMs could create value for both sponsors and consumers. the fans.*  Lastly, the report argues that the[ development of NFTs](https://www.blockchainx.tech/non-fungible-token-development) allows clubs to provide users with virtual access tokens and offer them a virtual experience. However, this would require a combination of digital assets and the metaverse, including both fungible and non-fungible tokens.  *""Virtual Access Tokens can enable special access during games, as well as new forms of social experiences and opportunities to interact with teams, athletes and other fans within a metaverse,"" PwC said.*  More specifically, Virtual Access Tokens can be another version of Season Tickets that provide holders with unique video content such as player cameras, bench cameras, or even locker room access. This could come in handy for fans who can't attend games in person.  As reported, the[ development of  NFT](https://www.blockchainx.tech/non-fungible-token-development) trading has recently slumped as geopolitical tensions and rising uncertainty continue to push investors into safe haven assets.",0.9888,0.029,0.847,0.124

"Hey all!  I recently stumbled across an NFT project that I have become quite fond of and wanted to share as there are still a little over 1,000 left to mint.   The name is Pit Crew and the artwork is of Pitbull's. Being an owner of two myself I had to jump on it just for the art alone. And that's not even the best part.  After the minting is complete, there will be weekly raffles with a 1-87 chance (even higher chance depending on the amount of Pits are in your wallet) of winning the pooled Solona.   The Solana for the raffle comes from 15% of all NFT sales. 1 Pit owner will receive 50% of that and 50 others will receive 1%.   Another bonus is that being a smart contract, the Solona winnings will be sent to the NFT owner's wallet automatically without having to allow any trusted apps to your wallet.

"I'm not a developer, but I was annoyed when I found out how vulnerable NFT files are in their current design, and makes the whole system unviable in my opinion. I came up with a technique to save underlying NFT files on-chain and here's what I posted in r/Cardano:  As many know, the underlying file that an NFT represents is almost always saved off-chain, making it possible that one day the underlying file could be corrupted, moved, or deleted. I'm putting together some research about a method to store NFT files on-chain by bundling sets of tokens and using their aggregated metadata to save file information. I guess we can call this a ""Native NFT"" or something like that. I'd like to get your thoughts on this.    The process would work as follows:   1. A file is converted into base64 or some other standard character string.    2. The character string is broken into smaller strings that would each max out the metadata of their own token, with an extra number padded at the front of the metadata string to indicate which string in the sequential order of all strings it lies.    3. The tokens will be linked together via a smart contract that makes it so when one token is sold, all tokens in the set are sent, so there will always be sole ownership of the entire NFT set.    4. When a user wants to view the file, they can just concatenate all of the metadata strings in order via some automated online tool that can read on-chain data.    A couple caveats about the technique, I think this would be too expensive for large files, since the number of NFT's scales linearly with the size of the file itself. I think though that this technique would be very beneficial for text based documents, such as important ones that allow society to function, such as deeds, patents, wills,  identity, contracts, and much more. Furthermore, once you have the data saved, you can link the Native NFT to other smart contracts and have some cool applications like escrow, voting, certification, credentials, etc.  There's also a possibility of incorporating compression to further make the data saving more efficient, or encryption techniques to make the underlying file unreadable to others on-chain without the right keys, though I'm not knowledgeable enough to know how exactly it would work.  What do you think? Can anyone on here develop this and show the results?",0.9888,0.031,0.852,0.117
"Hey guys. I'm looking for a study buddy/ies who wants to learn Web3 and NFTs with me.  I’ve been going around the rabbit hole and joining communities this first half of January to learn Web3 and NFTs, and I’m completely overwhelmed. It seems that the trend of decentralization and crypto is conquering the internet. So many communities and content out there.  From a non-tech background, I’m planning to take it step-by-step, learning fundamentals to advanced. I’ve found 2 relevant self-paced courses -- Web3 Foundation's Youtube MOOC and NFT fundamentals in Udemy.  It’s easy to binge-watch these courses for sure, but I’m thinking that learning effectively is better with small groups. You'll probably gonna ask me why not enroll in cohort-based courses or just rely on communities. cohort-based courses are pretty expensive and most of them are for software dev. communities are great to learn but they are too big (10k+++) to learn and discuss synchronously.  So I would like to ask if anyone here is interested to learn with a small group, discuss the lessons every week, share resources, and progress along the way? Let me know.

I've always loved TCG's (Magic, Yugioh, ETC) but loved the design of Tarot cards so I decided to mix the two together to offer a unique spin on NFT's. I've had my eye on nfts for a while because I like the idea of them and i've always designed as a hobby so I decided to give this a shot. I wanted each card to feel special with unique designs and a some text with a little bit of a backstory on each card. I'm doing each set as a theme and the first one is a dark set and each set comes in 4, with the 4th card being the rare one represented with the golden border and glitter. I do everything alone with the art, card stories and more and I hope you guys like what you see.   I'm not expecting to make any crazy sells or anything like that but I genuinely appreciate if anyone does and anything I make is going to my college funds and bills. Regardless I hope you guys just like the artwork and the next set is already in progress.",0.9889,0.026,0.786,0.188
"Right now, it seems like a majority of NFT content is quick cash-grabbing schemes and it reminds me a lot of the ICO hype in 2017. Every other day, some new art project pops up and the disc0rd gets filled with hundreds to thousands of people hoping to cash in and get a fresh mint. Everyone mistakes the hype for some semblance of a demand market when really 100% of these adopters are looking to flip their NFTs for 10x.  The same thing is happening with The Sandbox and Decentraland, with assets and land being scooped up as speculative assets. In my opinion, as the hype and speculation variable fall to 0 over time, these assets will lose a lot of money. What keeps a player base economy alive is a thriving player base, and what keeps a thriving player base is fun and addicting content. In their current state, the only thing that these NFT games have going for them is novelty, which wears off quickly. The creator tools are still not very powerful and may never reach the granularity that you can get in games like Roblox and Garry's Mod  The kings of the future of NFTs are the companies that already have a history creating content. Video game companies, film studios, artists with an existing following, etc. For games, it's a lot more difficult for a small company with NFT experience to create a fun, addicting online multiplayer world than it is for a reputable and experienced game company to create an in-game economy based on NFTs. Think CS:GO weapon skins, Team Fortress weapons, RuneScape cosmetics, WoW armor, etc. These items have an actual demand market because they have large and consistent player bases and the game content is created to be fun and engaging rather than simply rewarding ownership of any specific NFTs. The NFTs come secondary as a way to preserve the unique-ness of every piece of armor, every weapon, etc.  Why would a game company adopt NFTs for its item economy if it's perfectly able to control the in-game economy using simple, centralized chance based algorithms?  I think a big reason is trust and longevity in the values of in-game item. If I know ahead of time that only 5000 of some in-game cosmetic are going to be minted, then I know that I won't see this item being sold again in the game store and immediately I can assign it some value based on it's scarcity + demand. Even if the game company DOES decide to mint another 5000 of the same item, it will have to be some kind of 2nd gen or series 2 item set and by definition cannot be identical to the series 1, which forever exists within the Blockchain. (think gen 1 Charizard cards vs modern ones).  Another reason is the history of items. Imagine being able to look at a ledger and being able to see the entire history of an in-game sword. It could tie into the lore of the world. The value of a certain piece of armor or weaponry could fluctuate depending on if it was previously owned by a famous NPC or player.   Last but not least, for games where there are fleshed out in-game crafting mechanics, NFTs provide a transparent way to look at the rarities of item sets and ensure that the rarest buffs and attributes that have the lowest chance rates are never indistinguishable from items that may have the same attributes, but were made when chance rates are buffed or nerfed. This creates a kind of symbiotic trust between developer and community, as now there isn't an easy way for the developer to tweak a single variable to devalue the ton of work put into obtaining a rare item or cosmetic.   This is just me ADHD ranting but I'd like to know what people think of this and how NFTs are going to be adopted into the already existing gaming landscape.  Edit: TLDR The future of NFTs that have any value will be filled with content from existing content creators (Blizzard, Rockstar Games, Deadmau5, Damien Hurst, etc) rather than any of these new projects creating NFT based content from the ground up.",0.989,0.035,0.865,0.1

(to try and get with the times, I guess?) but they are sending a % of yearly grow profits back to the NFT holders essentially as a dividend after they become profitable as well as giving weed like 50% off to its holders once they begin expansion.

"There are currently more than 3,000 different types of digital currencies on the cryptocurrency market, the best known being Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin and Litecoin. Now we have to make room for maricoin, the world's first cryptocurrency aimed at the LGTBI community and which, moreover, is Spanish. Despite its pioneering status, it has generated great interest, causing a long waiting list for all those who want to invest in this currency, to do so it is necessary to enter the following link.    Behind this idea we find the Madrid businessman Juan Belmonte, known for his chain of hairdressers Juan por Dios, who, together with his team, has explained that from 31 December, it will be possible to quote and use this cryptocurrency in 25 'gayfriendly' establishments that are distributed in the neighbourhood of Chueca (Madrid), Maspalomas (Gran Canaria), Ibiza or Barcelona.    Same rights  Maricoin was invented for all those people who ""do not have the same rights"", as Belmonte explains in a promotional video on Youtube that already has more than 10,000 views, since this cryptocurrency ""is going to unify us, is going to give us power in this globalised capitalist world"", adds the entrepreneur.   In addition, Francisco Álvarez Cano, the CEO of maricoin, declares that apart from being unique for being created by and for this group, ""it will also have value as a means of payment for any transaction while becoming a tradable asset on an exchange"".      Project underway  As Belmonte explains, the project has already started to work, although it is not yet listed, and already has ""associations and organisations that support the LGTBI collective"" as well as ""more than 20 businessmen in Chueca"" and they plan to create a seal ""of quality, of equality, that will make all the people who use maricoin know that this business is supporting gender and sexual equality"".    The creators define it as ""a social, ethical, transparent and transversal means of payment"", with which, if everything works, they will be able to operate on the stock exchange from 2022, and what they are also looking for is for maricoin to enter an even wider market. According to the project's promoters, during the first quarter of next year, maricoin will be listed on Algorand's main exchanges and, if everything works out, it will continue on Binance, i.e. worldwide.      Possible future  As the currency has adopted the 'altcoin' model, its value is not like that of the euro or the dollar, but depends on supply and demand. During the month of January, the idea is to issue 250 million dollars worth of maricoins (the sum of 50 to the value of 1 euro) and those who want to buy them will have to do so for the value of the moment.    More and more different social groups are looking to have their own 'crypto', which is why time will tell if there is a future for maricoins. In the meantime, at the next Gay Pride it is expected that there will be acceptance and it is hoped to be able to finance the festivities with these cryptocurrencies.",0.9894,0.006,0.903,0.091

"**Tired of the same old avatars that are carbon copies of each other?** *We are too.* This is why we decided to take matters into our own hands and create something truly special unlike any other project out there!  DigiGames NFTs are a collection of uniquely designed game carts in a retro video game style on the Polygon block-chain. Each trait is a work of art, compiled using an algorithm to create distinctive NFTs. The initial release of NFTs will be game cartridges in the NES style. Our art and future development of other cartridges and systems will be forged by our community DAO of NFT holders.  We are a very small community right now, but we are hoping to change that with your help. Join our community and help us grow into something truly spectacular! Don’t miss your chance to get in at the ground level and reap the rewards.

"We're seeing the utility take shape across the sector, particularly in terms of improving various experiences, such as fan engagements for collectors or unique access to events, through the ownership of digital assets.       For example, Dak Prescott, the quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys, released a collection of NFTs in September 2021, with consumers able to unlock goods such as autographed cleats and game shirts. NFTs become more relevant to audiences outside of committed early adopters by fusing the real and digital worlds in this way. Essentially, by making art stand for more than just the digital portrayal, we're only scratching the surface of the technology's potential applications. Memecoins, a newcomer to the NFT realm, are making an appearance. NFTs are being developed by projects like Mononoke Inu and Shiba Inu, and they may be the new gem in 2022. We'll have to wait and see what comes.       NFTs have also been used for some more virtuous purposes. Deepak Chopra, for example, has just created Seva. Love, an altruistic NFT platform. Chopra wants to provide artists, charities, and marketers the tools they need to create communities around important causes through wearable digital artifacts. The fundamental blockchain attitude is one of social kindness and inclusiveness, and despite certain teething problems with environmental consequences and cybercrime, I believe enterprises dedicated to doing good have a bright future.

"Hello All,  I am a software engineer based in San Francisco bay area. I am 42 years old, with two kids. One of my kids had a brain tumor and passed away in November 2021 after fighting it for 18 months. During those 18 months, we made a lot of memories - short stories (audio recordings), paintings, art work, Lego toys, a whole lot of pictures with a story behind each one almost.   On the other hand, after my son passed away, unfortunately I had to deal with one more loss. My best friend, DJ, passed away earlier this month, again to an aggressive cancer. He left behind a stay-at-home wife and two kids. His older child, Aaryan is a really gifted artist, he makes a lot of drawings, paintings, sketches. He is merely 14 and probably has 30-40 of these already, and they are remarkable. I was thinking that I can narrate to him some incidents from my child's life, as well as some fun memories of his dad, and surely he will have a lot of those as well, and perhaps he can make some sketch, drawing, painting or any artwork that goes with the story, and then convert it to NFT. All the proceeds will go to Aaryan and his brother Ishaan's (6) education fund so they can go to college and complete their education. Right now, I am supporting them as much as possible.   Also, we are running a GoFundMe for this family, but it is nowhere near what we will need for college education.   If you are able to help us set this up so he can sell his artwork as NFTs, any advice or tips, I would highly appreciate it. Thank you so much. Please let me know if it is easier to speak on the phone, I will be happy to connect. Please DM me.  Thank you.",0.9896,0.033,0.82,0.147

"You don’t know my name, but what I will tell you is that I’m a student at MIT studying EECS. Both NFT haters and enthusiasts have been way more vocal than they really should be, so I’m going to try to be as informative as possible. I will avoid being confrontational, because I want to be helpful.  Also, I will refrain from talking about technology unless I know exactly what it does. This is because my specific knowledge of blockchain and cryptocurrency as a technology is limited. I know what they do, and the general idea of how they work, but they’re not my specific field of study. Please correct any mistakes I make, and I will edit them in. Opinions are unavoidable, but I will try to remain neutral. Where I give my opinions will (hopefully) be clear.   Please add your discussion. Ask questions where you are unsure, and add your input only if you are confident in what you are saying. Also know that I have a lot of speculation, because I believe the future of NFTs is very uncertain. I am making educated opinions and guesses, and banking off that education being very prestigious. Discussion is a fantastic way to make my educated guesses a lot more accurate.  #Misconceptions to clear up  Most of you probably already know the gist of it, so I will hit specific points that many get wrong. Don’t take this as insulting your intelligence if some of this is obvious to you. To many people, it isn’t, thanks to rampant misinformation.  * NFT ownership is not very powerful…yet. It’s a certificate of ownership, and in a lot of cases what people mean by “owning the link” means you have the right to a pointer, which is…mostly like owning the road that takes you to a certain thing. What this means is legally, it’s not very much to go on, not like copyright. Corporations and Organizations can and have have made policies designed to crack down and prevent theft of NFTs used on their premises, but legal action is impossible. Unfortunately, when most of the legislators in power are as old and tech-illiterate as they are, internet legislature is very poorly written. I am confident this will change to be a lot better. I am also confident that some NFTs will change so that they give ownership to, say, the property’s algorithm, giving it more power.  * NFTs themselves are not protected by blockchain. Blockchain is a very powerful encryption used for a very specific computation. Blockchain specifically is a fantastic method of certifying transactions, it makes a receipt that cannot be broken. Sometimes, that is the only part that is non-fungible. The receipt of the transaction, given the previous point, isn’t enough when taken with bad legislation and people dead set on making your stuff worthless.   * NFTs are not always bad for the environment. Unfortunately, many times, people who deal with cryptocurrency are not environmentally conscious. The big problem is that mining, transactions, and some other factors are incredibly power intensive and inefficient. A lot of initial hate for NFTs was stemmed from how all of this computer horsepower, money, and energy was spent on something that, in its current state, seems functionally useless. To be fair, people did also hate it when the richest 1% tossed this much money around for art when they could have spent on much more helpful things.    #The Future and my advice  Legislation will eventually improve, because politicians love money. The technology and infrastructure will improve as well (though I have a hunch those roads will be paved by poor project management, Red Bull, and tears). I think NFT’s will eventually be a lot better at being non-fungible…though there are a few wrinkles in the future plans.   ##Future NFT Value  Will NFT’s still be valuable in the future? I have some classes in statistics, but not 10 courses in economics so my guesses are educated.  I actually think so. What I would be a lot more worried about is if YOUR NFTs will be valuable. A more qualified economist can correct me, but I have high doubts that most of the “popular” NFTs now will keep their worth in 25 years. You want my opinion, the money will leave AI generated and template NFT’s for more…”unique” NFTs. I also believe that Image-based NFTs will take the longest to take off, simply because they will be incredibly hard to fulfill that non-fungible promise.  I am confident that most of the NFTs today are going to pop someday, and become worthless. It took some cryptocurrencies a long while to burst, but I would be very wary. And if they don’t burst, but instead reach stability, I would not be confident that the NFTs worth Millions would stay that way, or increase in value. Generally that’s not a good gamble, not just for NFTs.  I would not trust Bored Ape, or most of the “trendy” NFTs who are based on hype and size alone. I am confident they are in a road to destruction. I would either wait, or trust a more modest domain that is harder to copy, more honest about their works, knows a thing or two about money, and while I’m at it please choose someone who isn’t going to destroy the ice caps.  ##NFT Security  I previously said that BlockChain is very secure…you may want to be prepared in case it isn’t, because another technology is emerging that can destroy it if it actually takes off: Quantum Computation. Right now, advances in quantum computers are having a very hard time, but if a powerful enough quantum computer makes it to the real world, and more importantly, becomes accessible to the wrong people, a lot of cyber security is in massive trouble, including blockchain.   I think it’s possible to make advancements that mitigate the dangers, but if you are in cyber security, there is one law. The weakest link in all cyber security will always be the user. Don’t act like you are invincible. Actually that is something you probably want to follow today as well, too many ways you can get screwed over by your own hands.  ##Environment  As for the environment…experts of every field have been hard at work to do what they can, but that barely gives us a percent of an excuse. Please have a heart and try to be conscious of what you do. Support domains that are also environmentally conscious, and try to be green. A solar panel might save you money and pollution over time, and the right plants might not just decrease your footprint, but increase your lifespan by making your lungs healthier. You could definitely do other things too, but those two things would be directly beneficial to you if you need that push.   ##Fixing Public Opinion  Now this is the part I am least confident in. Take what I say with a grain of salt, but I think this idea needs to be thrown out, so that discussion can be made, and action can be taken.  I have high confidence that people will hate NFTs forever. Your neighbors spend this much money, use this much energy, have a bad track record with artists, among other problems, and people will always be angry, even if their anger is misplaced. But just because NFTs will be hated forever doesn’t mean you can’t make it with something that is basically the same thing. I will say that the root of the problem is that the three syllables remind me of examples that make my blood boil. But, maybe you can change it.   I will make a hypothetical NFT startup. For starters, do not say you sell NFTs. Instead, call your wares something like… CPC, abbreviation for Copy-Proof Claim. Now, throw hype and big stacks out of the window, aiming for modesty instead. Be as green as you can, only accept buyers if they don’t contribute to climate change. Partner with the great online art community far and wide. Make sure you’re as non-fungible as possible.   Play it all right, and you are now attractive to people who hate NFTs. This part is important. Advertise it, brag it, challenge the competition. Let the entire internet know that you are the most humane NFT and the others are bitches for not following your example. You know what that gives you to offset the lower prices? Customers.  Now, if anyone else starts saying they sell CPCs and aren’t looking too hot, destroy them. You are here to fix a reputation and attract customers. You’re in for the long term now. Some will come and die, but as long as you know what you are doing, you won’t sink. The general consensus will start to like CPCs, and the “NFTs” they hate so much will die off.",0.9897,0.123,0.724,0.153

"Hey guys, let's discuss a little bit about NFT Marketplaces as there are more and more of them every day, so I'm curious about how you managed to gain trust in some of them when you started using them. Did you mostly start trading on NFT marketplaces thanks to a recommendation or did you take a risk and listen to your intuition?     When my brother called me one day, he told me about the first shooting blockchain game and how impressed he was with the entire platform, so I asked if there was maybe an NFT Marketplace on that platform beyond games and Metaverse, and I received a positive response. My brother informed me that at their marketplace, they have absolutely everything.      So, that's how I found out about a new NFT marketplace called ICICB, they have also created that shooting game Ares my bro was talking about is pretty cool ( for all shooter fans heh), even if you don't want to test the marketplace.     Another great thing about it is that their marketplace is connected to their own Metaverse. This allows users to purchase NFTs like clothes, accessories, and cars to immerse themselves in their dream lives.      So far, I haven't had the courage to try any marketplace without a recommendation from a person I trust lol.    How did you find your perfect NFT marketplace?",0.99,0.024,0.793,0.183

"It's an interesting but not so shocking fact that according to Price Waterhouse Coopers' Sports Outlook 2022 study for North America, NFTs, and digital assets are one of the ten significant developments in the sports sector. The report discusses three main use cases for NFTs and their likelihood to shape the future of sports, which are:     NFTs Are digital assets that are collectible, authenticated, and limited edition. This refers to conventional memorabilia that can be digitized, minted, and exchanged on the blockchain, such as player trading cards or ticket stubs from historic matches. Now they are even being used for many different things, providing holders to participate in player transfers and help young, talented players to become football stars as is the case with the project K Club NFT.     Season ticket members, or STMs, are the second major use case Providing season ticket holders with certified tokenized passes would enhance an already devoted fan base's experience. STMs who are accustomed to receiving special edition collector NFTs for games they attend may also receive special edition collectible NFTs for the games they attend.     Finally, virtual access tokens are predicted to be in high demand among fans who choose to pay more for a virtual experience or who may not be able to attend games in person. Virtual access tokens dubbed a ""new form of season tickets,"" may allow owners access to more behind-the-scenes amenities like player cams, bench cameras, and even virtual locker-room access.

" Imagine you have a dollar, and you decide to exchange that dollar with your friend. Once the exchange is over, you will still have one dollar, in the same value, while your friend too will have one dollar, in the same value.  This is because a dollar and money, in general, are fungible goods, like shares of a company; it doesn’t matter from which stock exchange you buy a share of IBM, the value is the same, determined by the market.  However, in case you have an NFT, and then decide to exchange it with your friend, then things drastically change. Once the exchange is over, the NFT that you will have will be different from the NFT that you gave away.  This is because an NFT is by definition non-fungible entity: It’s unique, distinct, and cannot be replaced or divided. There are algorithms and meta-data behind every NFT, which makes it totally unique and distinct. If you have an NFT, then it’s only you who has that entity, in the entire world.  NFT or Non-Fungible Tokens are cryptographic assets that are created on blockchain technology, and have unique identification codes and meta-data, which makes them distinguishable, distinct, and completely unique.  In fact, even cryptocurrencies are not distinct, since they are identical to one another. This is the reason that they can be traded at equivalency for commercial usage, but not NFT, which are 100% unique.  I can easily create my innovation like art as NFT and reach a wider audience. I can get a higher value for my art as NFT unlike when I paint on a canvas. I have tried different NFT platforms like OpenSea, Rarible, Deedly Digital and Nifty Gateway, and I am grateful to them.",0.9902,0.0,0.838,0.162

"I'm hoping that this is ok but I wanted to assess an upcoming NFT and see if I am right on how I'm reviewing these. I’m unfortunately not involved in this project, but I would like to look at minting if my assessment is correct.   The NFT I'm checking out is Wild Goat Gang.   Artwork:  \*Sample link in comments\*  I really love the art work. It makes a lot of references to anime and other famous characters which drew me in and hopefully other nerds like me.   Utility:   This project will support goat sanctuary's in the real world which I feel like is a great use for an NFT.  They will also be creating their own token called $HAY as a way to customize your NFT and purchase some merch. It will also be used with future projects to create different/mutated forms similar to some of the bigger NFT creators.   At a 50% Mint sellout they are going to start branching out into the Metaverse (where it seems the world is moving to).   Community Size:  Their chat community is at right over 15K currently and growing. Its low in comparison to something like HapeBeast but it doesn't even have a release date yet and their already paying for advertisements.   In my newbie opinion it's worth pursuing as long as the community grows because it's only .08 eth to mint.",0.9903,0.023,0.799,0.178
"Yes, a big part of NFT gaming is about profits and I’ll admit its the main reason I joined in the first place.  But after spending a while here, I started noticing that there are only a couple games like Legends of Elumia considering how much the game play and graphics are great compared to other games, and maybe Battle Racers (but not so much recently).  But I’m glad that we’re starting to see some initiative in that regard with projects like ENGN working on introducing popular games into the NFT gaming universe.  This would definitely add some excitement to the NFT gaming scene without a doubt so let’s hope we start seeing more similar projects.",0.9903,0.024,0.674,0.302

The primary resource in the game is gold, oil, and ruby (cryptocurrency of the game).  **Token involved in the game:**  Mavia will serve as the governance token; Mavia is used outside of the game on the Mavia platform to buy and sell NFT and rent base. Mavia is not an in-game resource. The other cryptocurrency within the world is Ruby, the play-to-earn reward currency that gives the players the ability to upgrade their NFTs. NFT within the game includes base/land, heroes, and statues. The total amount of around announced thus far is 100K (soft cap).  **The team behind the game and investors:**  The game is being delivered by Skrice Studio, a game design and development studio based out of Hanoi, Vietnam. Their mission is to adopt disruptive technology, blockchain, within the video game world. The team includes over 60+ members worldwide, including several 3D designers, engineers, game developers, etc. One of the investors in Mavia includes Exnetwork Capital, an investment firm that funds innovative and decentralization projects.

Additionally, avocado DAO, another player in the cryptocurrency world, announced a $500,000 partnership in land acquisition and mafia token. Other notable partners include Genblock Capital, Binance Labs, Yield Guild; more detail can be found on Mavia's main website.

"Hi all!  I think I'm in the same boat as a lot of people here when I say I'm pretty new to the NFT world. I have heard a few times that anything and everything has a market as an NFT and wanted to ask here to see if that's really the case. Visual art wise, I think what I make is kinda nightmarish, but I do really enjoy world building.

"Hello everyone.....I'm a young orthopedic surgeon who is interested in how NFTs and blockchain backed technology will break into other consumer markets. Being in healthcare, I can definitely see the need and the utility as we move further away from traditional paper record keeping/record transfer to technology backed/profile based records. I'd love to use NFT technology to break into that market. At this point, my partner and I are looking to MINT an NFT collection. This is for two purposes:    1. I would like to attempt to generate a community for this goal. The goal of the project, in addition to below, would be to give access to initial interested peoples to invest in the push towards that technology. 2. Will Donate 20% of profits to a voted upon medical/healthcare base charity. If the contribution to public charity can be proven, then the real revenue potential could be presented seriously in that space. I think that is the first step to breaking into using this technology in healthcare. 3. We hope to use this process to generate some very interesting, comedic, visually appealing healthcare based character artwork to be sold on the NFT marketplace.  I'd love to get some feedback. It's obviously easier for me to sit here talking versus actually making this happen. I'm amassing a team now. I look forward to hearing comments. Cheers!",0.9905,0.007,0.816,0.177
"The native Non-fungible Tokens (NFT) of the Ninja Fantasy Trader ecosystem (NFTraders), allows one to earn in-game tokens called $NTC. This is done by making successful trades or staking for rewards. There are two types of NFTs on the PlayToEarn (P2E) GameFi protocol: Samurais and Seniors.   Although both NFTs give mouth watering rewards, owning Samurai NFTs gives you more utility tokens ($NTC) on each successful trade or staking reward.  Samurai features and tools allow you to achieve a higher income from $NTC Tokens per successful trade and other benefits. Samurai NFT holders will be granted access to the VIP Membership, including trading courses, daily market analysis, signals, a VIP Trading Group, and a community of thousands of real traders.  Staked Samurais give holders NTC token rewards. Any User who owns at least two NFTraders, either Samurais or Seniors, can create another Senior through a process known as “breeding”.

"Hi guys and gals!      I think I need some guidance from the experts (you) on where to start my NFT-journey. I think my strategy is kinda weird and rare, but I was hoping you could help me finding the best marketplace for the idea.      So here's the plan:   I am a composer with music I want to sell as NFTs. I'm not selling anything unique, and the tracks are available everywhere. The purpose of minting them is simply as a ""support the artist"" and reselling the NFT kinda thing.      I want to release hundreds/thousands of NFTs of one song, with different rarities (and the buyer can buy max 2 copies, and get two random rarities).    For example: Common (5000 copies), uncommon (1000 copies), rare (100 copies), epic (50 copies) and legendary (5 copies).    The rarer the NFT, the less reselling value comes back to me.    For instance, let's say the Common NFTs have a 50% reselling value, while the Legendary has 0,5% reselling value back to the minter (me).    I haven't quite worked out the details yet, and numbers are still work in progress.    So what I'm looking for a website that lets you mint a huge amount, and that lets me customize these thing properly.      I was hoping you would have some ideas for this :-)",0.9908,0.005,0.814,0.18

It will be a Whole year collection where A new NFT will be dropped everyday and will be apart of two sub-collections Colour and Borders.     Daily Colour collection is the background colour for the NFT, it corresponds to the colour for that day of the week; Monday = Yellow, Tuesday = Blue, etc… While the Weekly Border collection is a sub-collection for every week. One week of 7 NFTs will all have the same borders but never used again.    I also made a website for people who are interested in NFTs but aren’t sure how to get into them.

"    Let’s not twist the fact or play around. Gamers pay well. Entertainment is expensive. There’s a reason the gaming industry is huge. It is because gamers pay well. Pay to play has been the name of the game for too long, and now the new name is play-to-earn.  I love the fact that P2E games are making a big boom in the market and have everyone talking about them and investing deep. I like the fact that many people are using this chance to actually make a living and start some real profit and value.   More importantly, it seems that it is the people in smaller countries who are making the best of this. Such as was the case with Axie, and as is the case with Kitty Kart. Instead of paying hard earned money to play a game, you can now literally get paid while you do it.   This is a wonderful opportunity and many should take this.

You can buy virtual real estate on platforms like Sandbox and benefit and also play games like the ones on Polysports where people are forming teams and alliances and making actual money off of it while still having a great deal of fun.    Then there’s the fact that NFT have great uses in the services sector with projects like Last Hopium for example offering entry to very exclusive and executive style restaurants and hotels and access to important contacts.    This is all added benefits for the NFT market in the services sector later on when major brand go in all the way.

"Hey Guys i want to share our new project CDRS with you. Would love to get some feedback =)  **What is Crypto Duckz Rescue Squad**  CDRS is a top-down puzzle escape gaming experience which can be seen as a combination of the gameplay of pacman and zelda – a link to the past. The game is based on a NFT collection with a supply of 2525 units. On this point we are working on following utilities  · Creation of $QUAK-Token  · Singleplayer play2earn escape game  · Multiplayer versus mode  Utilities we are discussing for the future:  · Rpg-Version of the core game  · Tamagotchi-like pocket pet function of the NFT  · Breeding    [Duck](https://i.redd.it/f5ozpeawrfc81.gif)    **The story of the Wetlands**  **Short:**  The Crypto Duckz Rescue Squad is an elite search and rescue team put together with members chosen from all tribes of Crypto Duckz to find 4 ancient eggs to summon the old goddess „Anatidae“ to fight the aggressors which try to occupy their world.    [Duck](https://preview.redd.it/kj5kzsoxrfc81.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=238692649463b3295715645e34ef552a02da4e90)  **In detail:**  The Wetlands have been a peacefully place to live since the beginning of the new age but an evil enemy took advantage of the fact that no duck is really able to fight or do more than waddling and quacking. The ‚humeanity‘ slowly occupied the Wetlands and through the last years they polluted most of the lakes and seas right where all the little waddlers live.  One silent night, when you couldn’t even hear a single quack, the leaders of all eleven tribes of the Crypto Duckz met in a secret place to discuss if they have to leave the Wetlands forever. Never have they fought, so there is only one way to survive, waddle away. „There might only be one last chance“, the King of the Nyan Duckz said. „We have to go to Ducktopia, the old world of ancient Crypto Duckz, the home of the old goddess ‚Anatidae‘, the first and last Duck that ever was brave enough to bite after she quacked!“ – „This is only a myth, an ancient fairy tale!“ the King of the Pinky Duckz replied full of disbelief. All Kings knew the ancient myth that „Anatidae“ left four unique eggs on her last days, which when all combined can be incubated and magically unified to revive the old goddess. Each egg holds a part oft he mightiest of all Crypto Duckz, the beak, the feathers, the waddlers and the quack. Only „Anatidae“ can save the Wetlands.  The Kings went back to their tribes with the promise to send their fastest Crypto Duckz to put together the Crypto Duckz Rescue Team.    [duck](https://preview.redd.it/yaju3o00sfc81.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4120334c7f4b0addf842aecb91eb81df2174419)  [duck](https://preview.redd.it/3uh66o00sfc81.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b29c21a1a3e19b5ed4ef6b9cd9e38db5215f9a6)  The Crypto Duckz Rescue Squad is an elite search and rescue team put together with members chosen from all tribes of Crypto Duckz found in the Wetlands, the home of all waddlers. They are no warriors, they are no specialists, some of them aren’t even really smart, but they all have one in common. They are the fastest waddlers in the Wetlands. Put together by members of each tribe, each tribe hast to contribute the fastest 1% of their tribe to the CDRS. Depending on the speed and the rarity of each tribe some tribes contributed way faster duckz, but even so way less than other tribes.  Besides the 1% of every tribe the CryptoDuckz sent 23 unique generals with the power to waddle way more than regular Crypto Duckz. Their is a saying that of those generals three are descendants of „Anatidae“ and even a little bit more special than the other generals.

We organize and realize huge comedy concerts and are one of the biggest agencies in this section nationwide, even if we only employ 5 people. Because of corona we started to observe cryptocurrencies and NFTs and planned to create a project that can provide a source of income for every person who stays at home during the pandemic. Our agency was going through very hard times due to the lockdowns and the whole shutdown of liveconcerts in germany, so we felt like: 'Hey, this here is way more fragile than we thought, we and many other people maybe need something that can provide income while hard times, totally independent from the 'real world'.

The token can be used to play the game and will also be tradable. Further usecases will be discussed.

The difficulty of each level scales with the chance of getting extra loot.  Scaling features:  · Enemies move faster  · Player moves slower  · Enemies shoot (more/faster) projectiles  · More enemies attack the player  Every time the player starts the game either because he stopped playing or his duck get caught, he hast o spend one $QUAK-Token.After each successful round the duck achieves a treasure chest which always contains 1-3 $QUAK-Token and also has a small chance to drop an item from the community vault. The secondary loot drop can be everything from more Token, to all kind of ERC-721 NFTs which all will be tradable on OS. The vault is filled by the team with items paid by income through the project (50% of royalties and 25% of minting income directly goes to the vault).    https://preview.redd.it/ubfd6sfdsfc81.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95b2830a579c596ea87cec33992f773ac98e1fef  https://preview.redd.it/9j9y03gdsfc81.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1e5450eb9a42caa1e24ad9181c3f7eac046ceba  Storywise the vault also contains the 4 ancient eggs, which can be traded to the team for a not yet defined amount of Ether. The eggs work as a content blocker. If all four are found the ‚Anatidae‘ NFT can be found which enables fighting for all ducks and also ist he start for multiplayer and maybe a later rpg expansion.

"In the last year, we saw the biggest bull market in the history of blockchain, with an adoption rate that increased by over **300%**, and new trends such as **NFTs** that created controversial discussion in the space.  Traditional referral programs now focus on providing users with a whole range of decision-making in what they can choose to gain, from experiences such as movie tickets to cashback in fiat currency purchases.  However, this wide horizon of decisions about things that people can get as rewards comes with a lot of problems and inconveniences from companies. Seeing this high adoption rate in the crypto market, some companies are beginning to consider restricting their rewards program options to a more compact and attractive solution. For example, **Mastercard** has decided to enter this new domain, by introducing innovative loyalty and referral programs with cryptocurrency.  But for brands to start offering crypto rewards in the form of chips and **NFTs**, they need well-trained engineers with space experience and a capable team of marketers who can handle the entire business at acceptable costs. The faster movement in recent years has taken many companies unprepared, with a lack of specialized people able to adapt to new market conditions.  [**Runus**](https://runus-landing.netlify.app/) can solve this problem with its innovative system which offers auto-generated referral codes and a pool of rewards that the business chose for the referral campaign. Only with a few clicks, businesses can start their crypto referral program and mint for their new customers unique NFTs with special attributes.  Crypto referral marketing can convert your loyal customers into your top marketers at a significantly less cost. As you know popular crypto games have made so many people earn more money by playing regular and earning tokens for their skills. Why not convert normal people and incentivize them to become your promoters?  A new era is approaching, but we are still in the phase of early adoption. If you decide to join today, you will have so much to earn.",0.9911,0.033,0.811,0.156

" TL;DR - Do not sleep in Ragnarok Meta! Check comments to get access to the game demo and social channels. See Karafuru and RagnarokMeta twitter for more details on the collab.     Ragnarök and karafuru have teamed up to allow you to play with your Karafuru as a character in Ragnarök Meta a new Play 2 Earn MMORPG style game being built on AVAX. This is huge news for all karafuru holders because now your Karauru NFTs don't have to just sit as twitter PFPs and can be used in quests to kill pixel monsters and will be able to be leveled up with accessories and weapons!  For those of you unfamiliar with the Ragnarök project, I have provided some basic info below. This project is going to **BLOW UP** so do not pass this opportunity up. They have already released a playable game demo with weekly in-game quests to earn ML spots BEFORE selling a single NFT or releasing their in-game currency coin. This is completely different then most other projects that sell NFTs with just a promise of a usable product in the future.  If you don't own a karafuru do not worry. Ragnarök will be releasing their own NFTs and the art is absolute fire! Check the picture below for a sneak peak at what the project offers!! The team hopes to one day bring all the big name NFT projects to Ragnarök so if you own a BAYC or Azuki stay tunned, their is a good chance you will be able to use your NFTs in-game too.     [Sneak Peak at the Ragnarok Ronin Zero NFTs](https://preview.redd.it/di9h7j3rial81.jpg?width=2077&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cd4167a4119803aa74802f049349a1890937dbf)    https://preview.redd.it/l27pnmqtial81.jpg?width=1500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a8ad43d6714f5a9a6520c5259afcea9ad3c34a3     **✚ The Origin**   The idea was born out of a frustration at the lack of a fun game in the crypto space. We set out to create a real web3 game, driven by a strong focus on narrative, which is backed by 77 Manga chapters that will be released over the course of 3 years. The active development on Ragnarök (like Game Design, Gameplay/Mechanics, economy etc.) started mid 2021.    **✚ So what is Ragnarök, really?**   Ragnarök is a browsed-based web3 Multiplayer Role Playing Game. The game is Lore-Driven with new content that reveals itself along with each new release of the Ragnarök manga. Players will endeavour into the metaverse with their Ronin NFT as their own unique in-game character. Discover a world of epic adventures, combat friends or foes (pvp, pve), levelling, class advancement, looting, NFT crafting, trading, owning &amp; customising your own buildings, and hanging out with Frens in a powerful social experience.    **✚ How can someone play Ragnarök?**    Owning a Ronin will be the only way to play Ragnarök at the start. The Genesis Ronin are the genetic ancestors of all future Ronin to appear in Ragnarok, and there will be 7777 of them.  They have great usage, with both in-game and financial advantages. We are currently crafting a Medium post to dive deep down the rabbit-hole and show you all the wonders of the Genesis Ronin.     **✚ Token**   $RAG will be the main currency of Ragnarök's game.  The coin will have high utility in the whole game economy and intrinsic value growth.  Absolutely NO token has been released by Ragnarök yet. Please be safe and ensure you don’t get scammed! There's a fine line between Genius &amp; Failure, the fine line between $RAG and $RUG.    ✚ **Chain** We are built upon Avalanche and Ethereum. ETH is where the NFT's will be minted, and the game will  run on AVAX.",0.9911,0.044,0.832,0.124
" It's been such a journey within the NFT space and I felt it was my duty to highlight some of the crazy, weird, exciting, inspiring, and downright mind-blowing events that have taken place. My list of what shook the world as we know it.....with NFT's.    1. Beeple sells his NFT ""Everydays: The First 5000 Days"" for $69 million at auction. 2. Jack Dorsey's first-ever tweet on Twitter sold for $2.9 million at auction. 3. Sir Tim Berners-Lee (inventor of the internet) sold 9,555 lines of original source code as an NFT for $5.4 million. 4.

"I'm not a fan of how NFT game discussions are always so profit-driven. Profits are important in NFT gaming, but they are not the only factor to consider. I think it's understandable given that there aren't many entertaining but still profitable NFT games.  I play Gods Unchained because I believe they have the best balance of fun and profit. What's encouraging is that projects like ENGN are working on bringing popular games from the real world into the NFT universe, so let's hope we see more projects like this one pop up in the future.",0.9912,0.037,0.615,0.348
"Have you seen the shit coming from others in the NFT market?!  I just read a BusinessInsider article where this journalist tried to join the NFT market. In concluding his beginning move, he bought an avatar. In reporting that, he furthered my point that he really doesn’t know the next step as he “hopes” that this random avatar becomes grand one day like BAYC.  That article insists that NFTs are speculative assets, which are known by most economists who define NFTs. Nonetheless, our market is becoming more speculative instead of the expected renaissance of art from the best of us. Now, the democratization of NFTs, as the Nasdaq puts it, is dooming the quality of art present in our markets.  People like me… we are trying to uphold some personal standard. Nonetheless, the market is distracted with gimmicks that lack creativity so that truthful and artistic creators can’t compete in the market and even among themselves. It is hard to find two creators who are trying their best to out-art the other, yet it is easy to pin the two best projects that focus on a shaky concept as speculation and perceived value.  It quite literally pisses me off. I believe in a future so I am conservative when it comes to my effort to make a name for myself in this market. I hope others like me from below and above are also thinking of these internally instituted principles. Nonetheless, the quality of art provided by the society present in the NFT market is stupid poor and it can surely do better.  It is up to us truthful and artistic creators to lead the market - towards a progressive standard using fair competition and ethical business tactics - when the high mountain climbers who enlist in short term schemes and create monotonous art -  fall down from their peak without a clue of their salvation.

"When Ubisoft became the first significant games publisher to throw its hat into the NFT (Non-Fungible Token) ring last year, the gaming community’s reaction was mixed. Given the experimental nature of their exploration, the French publisher took the feedback to heart and has said that NFTs represents a “major change that will take time.”   More recently, Square Enix president [Yosuke Matsuda](https://mobidictum.biz/square-enix-ceo-announces-plans-for-blockchain-metaverse-nft/) said that the *Final Fantasy* publisher is also exploring implementing NFTs in its games. Matsuda believes that NFTs will be particularly useful in boosting user-generated content in games.   EA CEO Andrew Wilson, too, has suggested that NFTs and play-to-earn gaming are the “future of our industry.” Meanwhile, on the retail side, [GameStop](https://mobidictum.biz/gamestop-enters-blockchain-and-nft-market/) is planning to create a virtual marketplace where players can buy, sell, and trade NFTs.  According to [Interpret](https://interpret.la/gamers-are-embracing-nfts-interpret-data-finds/), while NFTs, cryptocurrency, and blockchain have drawn heavy criticism due to scammers and the environmental impact of crypto mining, gamers have undeniable interests that publishers cannot ignore. Interpret recently queried 1,500 players from its 5,000+ member NFT/crypto gaming panel (a subgroup of Interpret’s 30,000+ member Good Gamer Group).   The panel represents Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, mobile, and interested PC players, who are not interested, have previously owned, or currently hold an NFT or cryptocurrency. The key takeaway: over 56% are interested in the idea of being able to earn NFTs through playing video games.  Moreover, NFTs could play a significant role in retention (of critical importance to live-service games). Over 45% indicated that earning NFTs through gaming would increase their current gaming engagement levels. Additionally, over 53% indicated that making NFTs is the primary driver, compared to being able to sell/trade NFTs and the idea of building an NFT collection.  Jesse Divnich, Interpret’s Senior Vice President of Growth and Innovation, said:  &gt;*“Building a collection is not the major motivator right now. Gamers are not yet viewing NFTs as they would Pokémon cards or collecting a complete set of similar items. Gamers just want to be able to participate in this new business and engagement model.*   &gt;   &gt;   *Currently, becoming an NFT owner is a cumbersome process with numerous steps across multiple systems and programs. Gamers are likely looking to the industry to help create a more streamlined process towards NFT ownership and participation.”*  As a result, it is thought that the [play-to-earn](https://mobidictum.biz/para-kazandiran-oyunlar-play-to-earn/) model will continue to rise. Many reviewers believe that 2021 is just the beginning of this model. Here, [NFTs](https://mobidictum.biz/blockchain/) are seen as cash flow drivers in the market, and they continue to be the center of attention.  \--  If you want to NFT Gaming reports to your email box, let us introduce you to our [Blockchain weekly newsletter](https://mobidictum.biz/newsletter/?source=reddit).",0.9912,0.011,0.869,0.12
"   Simple Pandi is an upcoming NFT project that acts as a one-stop-shop for various blockchain niches such as NFTs, crypto mining, metaverse events, and more. It solves one of the significant challenges people face in the blockchain world: Participating in numerous projects across the blockchain industry and enjoying them all.   Simple Pandi NFTs bring all the spaces mentioned above together under one project by providing them as utilities for the NFTs people purchase.  ## NFT Rarity Levels and Utilities  There are 10,000 unique NFTs in this project, and every NFT has a rarity level. Based on their rarity levels, a utility and a specific yield amount are attached to the NFT.   For instance, one NFT can provide you a yield of $5 per day while giving you access to a metaverse event. On the other hand, another NFT will provide you with a yield of $10 and get you access to a physical sports event. Like this, other utilities and yield amounts are attached randomly to NFTs of varying rarity levels. It's okay if you don't end up with a rare NFT, you can always grow your Pandis rarity level by feeding it bamboo stalks.  The main offerings of the project are as follows:  * Community Mining and Yielding Projects * Cloud Mining/ GPU Mining Yielding Projects * Sports, Entertainment, and Nightlife Event Admissions * Metaverse and Physical Hangout Rooms * Metaverse Games and Passive Income Metaverse Projects * Community Parties and Fundraising Events * Pandi Clothing &amp; Canvas Drops * Earn Daily Royalties Commissions  ## How Does The Crypto Mining Utility Work?  To ensure that the crypto mining utility is profitable for all the NFT holders and functions efficiently, Simple Pandi has a three-pronged approach:  ### Partnership with Crypto Miners  The project will collaborate with miners across the world who mine various cryptocurrencies. These miners will deposit a portion of their earnings into our community pool. This pool will then generate the necessary yield for all the NFT holders and distribute the amounts to them based on the rarity level of their NFTs.   ### Cloud Mining/ GPU Mining Projects  The other approach includes GPU and cloud mining. Cloud mining is an emerging field in the mining industry. Considering it is becoming increasingly difficult for miners to maintain hardware and software for their operations when it comes to GPU Miners, they are slowly turning towards cloud mining as an option.   Simple Pandi will invest in cloud miners for every NFT sold. This partnership will help gain more funds for the community pool, which will be distributed amongst the NFT holders.   ### Allocation of Sales &amp; Royalties  This project will set aside 25% - 35% of each NFT sold as well as a 8% royalty added onto each NFT. With this stream of income Simple Pandi will deposit funds into its community pool which will then be distributed amongst the NFT holders depending on rarity levels.  These are the three main approaches the team takes to enable NFT holders to earn a passive monthly income. Based on their NFT’s rarity level, any holder will earn between $.001 and $500 per day.   So what are you waiting for? I’d say a Simple Pandi NFT is a great option when you are looking into the future of NFT’s.

"So, I am not new to crypto, but I am new to NFTs.  I wanted to jump in, and I already got a thetan arena skin.  I was happy with that purchase, although I don't think I'll end up making money as I initially thought.  For those who don't know, it is one of the many play to earn gaming projects out there.  It is a fun game, though, at least.  The second thing I got was ""NFTKeys.""  I am starting to wonder about my second purchase.  Even though they are only $25, I am still starting to get nervous because only 60 have been sold out of 10,000.  I originally found them on a listing for nfts called NFT Calendar.  Can just anyone post an nft on there, though?  How am I supposed to evaluate the value of nft projects?  The NFTKey sounded really cool, you get to open a vault with prizes once a month.  On the other hand, pay first gain second is a pretty common scam format.  I looked at the address I got the NFTKeys from, and there doesn't seem to be anything odd.  I believe it is a project that somebody out there is doing to gain awareness for their token's utility; then again, the only comments under the bscscan page are basically, ""Be careful with projects like these.""  Who the heck is the person that left that comment though?  I don't know.  The rules for buying crypto, in general, for me are usually:  1.) The token has a utility (usually unique to itself).   2.) There is either a company behind the coin, or else there is a pop culture demand for it.   3.) There is short and/or long range profit potential.  I thought that NFTKeys met these requirements; except now I realize I was using the general popularity of nfts to justify #2, while there wasn't a particular popular demand for these NFTKeys, yet.  It still seems legit to me, but what do you all use to measure legitimacy for you nft purchases?  Trying to learn the game here.  It's foreign to me.",0.9913,0.05,0.802,0.148

"**Roller Coin**     We’re kicking-off with one of the more unique games on the list – Rollercoin. It’s designed to teach you how cryptocurrencies and blockchain work in a much more intuitive way.  In the game, you’re essentially mining – just like you would in the real world – but you don’t need any special hardware and you don’t need to know too much about crypto. It’s an excellent starting point for beginners, but even if you have experience with crypto, it’s still worth checking out.  To get involved, you sign-up and just start playing the fun mini-games. The more you play, the more you’ll earn.  The games are crypto-themed, but based on popular titles with activities like Flappy Rocket, Token Blaster – a Space Invaders clone – 2048 Coins, and much more.  Eventually, you’ll make enough in-game coins, called Rollercoins, to buy a miner, rack, and other tools. Equipping those items means you’ll earn currency even while you’re offline.  The more time you invest in the game, the more you’ll earn, and you can choose exactly what crypto you’d like to earn – from Bitcoin to Ethereum, or even Doge – or split your earnings between these crypto heavyweights and the in-game currency.

"The vibrance of the NFT ecosystem is gaining massive attention by the day. New projects are springing up in the ecosystem, and most are dedicated to taking NFTs beyond just jpegs and giving them real-life utilities. SportsIcon is one of such projects, and they are bridging the gap between fans and their favorite sporting heroes, thereby bringing an exciting dimension to fandom. Holding the Lion NFTs makes one a member of the Lion Club, which comes with amazing benefits like having sports-related NFTs airdropped to you, and having to meet with sporting icons. A notable example of this is when members of the Lion Club had a zoom meet-up with the legendary Luis Figo. With the Super bowl coming up, it is going to be an amazing time for lion club members, as 3 tickets will be up for grabs. Apparently, the more Lions you own the better! Weeks ago, it was news when Floyd Mayweather bought a Lion NFT, becoming a member of the Lion Club which IMO is a good one that would promote adoption. They are also in partnership with Romelu Lukaku and are working on dropping his NFT. This is one I’m earnestly looking forward to.",0.9914,0.0,0.805,0.195
"Hi, newish to NFT's and looking for input on monetization rules for a planned set of NFT's I'm making.  I am planning on it being on Loopring L2, ideally in the new Gamestop marketplace eventually, but for now I am trying to think up how the money would work, so as to make the use of the NFT more approachable instead of collectable while still paying me and its owners for fair use.  The NFTs can be used piecemeal or as a set, like an alphabet where you could use just 5 of the elements to make up your name (""Patsy"") or you could use the entire set of 26 characters to write out a paragraph/slogan (""the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"").  In this example, let's say Patsy wants to print her name using the characters on a mug, or a t-shirt, so she buys just the 5 NFT's she'd need to get printed by an output company (ie. [Pixels.com](https://Pixels.com)), I'd get paid for the 5 letters use to print, and Patsy would now own a slice of each of the 5 letters.  However, Manu wants to print his manifesto using the characters so he wants to buy the whole alphabet.  He gets a usage discount because buying the whole set allows him to use multiple characters multiple times, since the vowels are going to get used a lot compared to the letter ""Q"", but since he's buying the entire set, he would also own a slice of each individual characters NFT.  ...or something like that.  I'm just trying to think of how this could work, so any suggestions/ideas are appreciated.  Ideally I want people to be able to use the entire set of NFT characters at a discount while one time uses of specific NFTs would also be possible.  I want multiple people to be able to own the NFTs as opposed to one collector, and anytime the NFT's are used, all the owners get a cut.  Usage of the NFT's also wouldn't have to force ownership, hopefully there could be a pay-to-use kind of licensing ability to the NFT, so Patsy could still print her mug but might not want to own a slice of the 5 letters involved, she just wants a mug, but everyone who owns a piece of the 5 characters gets a sliver of what Patsy paid at [Pixels.com](https://Pixels.com) to use the NFT design.  Would this create a situation where people might ""invest"" in the vowels because they know they will get used more often?  What about certain letters in our example being worth more because they are ""rare"", like the letter ""X"" having a higher point value in scrabble?  Can an NFT have rules that change depending if the NFT exists as part of a purchased set vs standalone?  Just brainstorming here and interested in people's input here as I suspect there's a few of you h=who are thinking about NFT's beyond collectable art sales.  Thanks!",0.9914,0.017,0.878,0.105

"""By definition, a synthetic asset is  to a mix of assets that have the same value as another asset. They combine derivative products that imitate an underlying asset like currencies, indexes, stocks, bonds, commodities etc. in simple terms, they allow investment firms to leverage on multiple financial vehicles instead focusing all their investments on one asset.  Crypto synthetic assets employs the same methodology giving subscribers exposure to a range of different component assets without needing to hold the underlying asset. This is fantastic because a crypto investor doesn’t have to leave the crypto ecosystem to hold assets from fiat currencies (e.g United States dollar or British pounds ) to commodities like gold and silver by holding tokens that are mapped to the value of these assets.   To make investing in crypto synthetic assets a lot easier you can subscribe to protocols like konstellation.tech’s alkemy.

Learn the cultural jargon. 2. Follow the right people on Twitter. 3. Leverage your web2 skillsets. 4. Document your learning journey and share it. 5. Observe what people are sharing on social media. 6. Do the fundamental analysis. 7. Buy what you like. 8. Take note of movements in the cryptocurrency market. 9. Take profits. 10. Take security practices seriously. 11. Remember to take breaks in this 24/7 market.   Hope this is helpful to you in any way!

I think a lot of these major gaming companies have already put this idea into consideration but they’re most probably waiting to see how the NFT gaming market will play out this year considering how young it still is.  In fact we already have projects like ENGN working on introducing some of the most popular games we love into the NFT gaming market.

"Gaming NFTs, in my opinion, are the best use case for blockchain-based NFTs. Unique tradable and purchaseable objects are in high demand in gaming. Their scarcity has a direct impact on their value, and gamers are already used to the concept of valuable digital objects. Microtransactions and in-game purchases have spawned a multibillion-dollar gaming sector that could benefit from NFTs and blockchain.  In terms of what an NFT signifies, it's also a fascinating field. Tokens for video games mix elements of beauty, collectability, and player function. However, NFT deployment in big-budget video games is still a long way off. Other projects, meanwhile, have aggressively integrated blockchain technology into their games.  Both Axie Infinity and Battle Pet are Pokémon-style games that feature tradable pets and items. You may also buy and sell these tokens on third-party exchanges (peer-to-peer sales). Gaming NFTs might be just decorative, but many also serve a practical purpose. Each Axie pet has a unique set of fighting abilities. When a pet is traded, these abilities have an impact on its value. Just for its excellent breeding qualities, a CryptoKitty can be quite valuable. The value of each pet is determined by a combination of unusual appearances, traits, and utility. We don't notice just one desired, rare aspect in the case below, but several.  Gaming is no longer only about having a good time. It's all about making money while having a good time. I would like to introduce to you a new NFT project, HUBBER. Most significantly, with its well-defined and organized smart contracts and gamified mechanisms, $HUB ensures that gamers are adequately compensated.",0.9917,0.036,0.782,0.182

Thank you  Alright so I’ve just started out on OpenSea. I’ve got 8888 .PNGs that I’m ready to upload. I’ve paid for the “initialize your wallet” fee which was for me apparently $22 and the “OpenSea access to your NFT” fee which was almost $3 . However from what I had read and heard from before this seems waaaaaay to cheap. I’ve heard that it could be somewhere around $70-$300 Initialize the account and $10-$30 for the OpenSea access to NFT. Now I know that the prices to go up and down but this much? Does this mean that there will be a lot of other fees I’ll have to pay for when uploading these 8888 pieces or just later on? Because I have read that you’ll have to pay when accepting offers and things like that  Also on most of the videos I’ve seen with people using these bots when bulk uploading NFT they all select Polygon because of there not being any gas fees there and they’ve all said that Ethereum will be way to expensive is that just because of those 2 one time gas fees or is it something else that occur if you upload a HUGE amount of NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain? because it wouldn’t be really fun to upload 8888 pieces and then boom now you’ll have to pay this huuuuge fee because of the amount you have uploaded.

There are currently 5,555 bears, bulls, and wolves ready to be owned by the WSD community!  The main goal here is to provide NFT holders with a new class of utility-based NFT, one of which has never been seen before in this space. If there’s one thing that’s going to pay off in the long run, it’s being the first person to do something unique!  Each holder will gain access to our immaculate utilities, with all of them being divided into four major pillars:  * NFT Burn * Crypto Calls * DAO Investment Fund * Crypto VC  While other NFT projects rely on hype and popularity to remain profitable, Wall Street Dwellers is using processes like NFT Burn to speed things up. When you’re burning off excess NFTs, it means whatever is left over is going to increase in value (it’s a natural process).  A **buyback plan** is in place that will purchase and burn around **40% of the collection**, leaving only 3,333 NFTs in total for the public market. As if that weren’t enough, they use a Community-based NFT switch process to burn the Dwellers that people like the least.  Post the NFT burn program, 50% of the all the royalties from the secondary market will be used for DAO investments, allowing our NFT holders to profit even when they aren’t looking to be active in the NFT marketplace. Whether there’s a bull or bear cycle present, it doesn’t matter; you’re still bound to make passive income just by holding one.  Not only is Wall Street Dwellers a growing community, but it’s also one that specializes in diversification among your holdings. You aren’t just buying an NFT, you’re purchasing everything that comes along with becoming a Wall Street Dweller yourself.  # NFT Rewards  The Wall Street Dweller collection is meant to be a limited one and is divided up into specific categories of rarity. Not only are there different tiers available, but there are also plenty of exclusive perks up for grabs to any NFT minters out there.  # Exclusive Mint Rewards  These perks are still yours to benefit from even if you’ve sold your NFT on the secondary market — once you’ve become a Wall Street Dweller, you’re part of the family forever!  # Rarity Levels  There are four levels of rarity available, all of which will be linked to your minted rewards. The tiers and percentages are:  * Common (67%) * Rare (20%) * Exceptional (10%) * OG (3%)  Anybody who can get their hands on an “OG” Wall Street Dweller will not only have one of the most exclusive NFTs available, but they’ll also receive the highest rewards possible.",0.9922,0.017,0.857,0.127
"The global fashion industry generates over $3 trillion in revenue but designers and creators all over the world still find it difficult to stand out and be fairly compensated for the quality of their designs.  In fact, geographical constraints and unfavorable business environments keep a significant portion of the global talent pool from getting equitable access to the resources and opportunities they need to build a successful career in fashion. While 3D fashion design software like CLO made it easier for designers to work from home, digital fashion remains a relatively new market segment with creators still discovering how to sustainably work and create value for themselves.  There are news about this upcoming project called [Faith Tribe](https://faithtribe.io/) which brings together the global community of designers, artists, curators, bloggers, influencers, brands, and buyers in an incentive-aligned way, allowing participants to earn tokens through their contributions to the ecosystem. This can really unite all of the creators in a healthy ecosystem.  Faith Tribe is building the first decentralized ecosystem for the collaborative creation of fashion goods by a multi-platform solution that will be used by different stakeholders to accomplish different goal involving a Web3 based NFT Marketplace and Design Protocol where you can Design NFT, access Studio Liquidity pools and Asset Exchange. Not a single technical or non technical decision is planned to be taken without voting from the community.",0.9922,0.013,0.804,0.183
"# Introduction  Lately I've seen the term ""web3"" coming up more and more. I can't entirely wrap my head around it yet, but thanks to [this article](https://future.a16z.com/why-web3-matters/) I've got a pretty good idea on what it does and why it's needed. Basically we want to combine the old decentralized web1 with the centralized but powerful web2, to create their better brother; web3.  But how do you get that started? How do you make people realise the potential of web3? How do you get it adopted by the general public? I recently came across [a thread on twitter](https://twitter.com/GetProtocol/status/1471830808625393669) that suggested NFT ticketing is the entrypoint we've been looking for.  # NFT Ticketing  I assume I don't need to explain this sub what an NFT is, but perhaps a little recap on NFT ticketing is in place.  A ticket to an event has basically always been non-fungible; No 2 tickets are exactly the same. The combination of event, artist, venue, timeslot, chair number, serialnumber, you name it, is unique and therefore your ticket is unique. Except for a little thing called a copy machine, which could make an exact (although officially fake) replica of your paper ticket.  That's our cue for NFT tickets, where storing the ticket on a blockchain makes sure there's indeed only 1 ticket of a certain combination of the aforementioned aspects. This gives rise to a lot of other cool possibilities, but I won't go into that here. There's a sub called NFTTickets where you can read more about this usecase.  # NFT Ticketing as entrance to web3  Back to the original point; web3. The problem with web3, as mentioned in that thread, is as follows:  &gt;But an area that needs significant improvement is the current entrance complexity for the everyday person to get setup and involved.  The statement made is that NFT ticketing could potentially be the bridge for the general public to enter and participate in web3. Or in more fancy wording:  &gt;NFT Tickets are an extension of access rights that go above and beyond a traditional ticket by providing a direct inroad into an event organiser or artist's community through Web 3 platforms and protocols.  https://preview.redd.it/25mvmqmim3781.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b2d3d8fe00c98db3846cac19e481ca7a7584cfe  # My question to you  It makes sense to me that, when done correctly, something like NFT tickets could 'lure' in the general public and make them participate in web3 without much of a barrier like a need for understanding.  What do you think about this? Could NFT ticketing be the entrance we were looking for? If yes, why do you think so? If no, why don't you think so and what do you think would be the right entrance?",0.9922,0.021,0.859,0.12

"Hi everyone,  I understand what NFTs are from a few videos that I saw. I've had a few arguments about them which usually ended with the other side telling me that I just ""don't get"" NFTs and I would if I were part of the community, so I'd love some more insight from the community!  So what the community tends to say is that ""NFTs are immutable receipts of ownership stored on the blockchain"". The example frequently used is that an NFT is like the original copy of the Mona Lisa, whereas all other files of the image are like copies of the Mona Lisa. This means that ""NFTs"" are ""tokens of ownership"" of an original artwork.  This sounds good, but from my understanding (and what is causing a lot of confusion) is that NFTs on the technical side are typical ""tokens"" of URLs pointing to a specific address where the image is stored.  My question is how does this exactly translate into ownership? How does ""owning a token of the URL"" mean that ""you own an original artwork""? What makes the URL special? Especially considering that I can tokenize the same URL on a different blockchain - meaning that I can own the exact same URL pointing to the exact same image as someone else. Doesn't that mean that we both own the ""original artwork""?  In addition, whereas the Mona Lisa is non-fungible, digital artwork very much is. Owning an NFT pointing to a specific artwork does not mean that you have exclusive rights to do anything with that artwork - If I own the original Mona Lisa, only I can hang it up somewhere, throw it off a cliff, donate it to a museum, or whatever. With digital art, I can save the artwork, post it, make it my pfp, and even get the ""verified NFT holder"" twitter avatar, all without owning the NFT.  I understand that the NFT can give you access to a club - but still this as well as other perks doesnt answer my question about how this makes you ""own"" an original artwork.  I would love to see what the NFT community thinks about this, because I'm sure that the community at large understands these criticisms. Thanks!",0.9922,0.011,0.859,0.13
"The public who love sports is increasingly integrating blockchain technology with the purchase of fan tokens and NFTs from their favorite clubs.  Spain has become a striking point in which sports fans are increasingly immersed in the blockchain environment due to the adoption of different factors of blockchain technology that have been adapting more and more to any environment of daily life.

Currently in the Spanish territory there is an adoption of 34% of these products of the new digital age because, as time has passed, more clubs have joined Atlético de Madrid and FC Barcelona, ​​which were initially the teams that stand out from the rest by employing this type of strategy with their followers.

"  The first two waves of NFTs already broke records, either profit-wise or considering the hype they generated. At one point even the shop owner next door in my third world country asked me about NFTs LMAO.   Though I feel there is still more to it, and it can still generate more hype, more rewards and more profits. It’s not a dead horse yet and I’ve got my cash ready to reinvest and re-profit.   Just the other day someone here mentioned the Royal Falcons Club, a new NFT system with unique and special rewards mechanism. Basically, each edition has unique and special desirable rarities that generate unique rewards? An interesting concept I must say and a significant addition to the NFT marketplace.   Are they similar projects that are creating hype and innovation, ready to break the roof yet again? I want to look into similar and concepts and projects that are providing more value, I personally feel these would be more beneficial over the long run.

How can NFTs bring real value to my current clients who hire my team and I to develop creative content for them?  2.

"Hi all,  I am an ecologist and nature photographer that transforms original photos into digital art. My goal is to share the beauty of our planet's biodiversity and hopefully help people to see this life in a different, positive light. Each image has been carefully crafted and I think there's something for everyone (as long as you like birds and dragonflies, of course). Also, there's a few ""Cryptych's"": 3 NFT's that award the fourth full image if all are collected.    Rather than just shill, I'd love to hear some input on a few things. Minting on Eth seems severely hypocritical for a nature-based artwork project. However, I have yet to make a sale on Polygon and can't seem to get many views. I'd love some advice on how to improve or stand out amongst the randomly-generated absurdity. I plan on putting all proceeds back into my passion and vision, expanding to create educational videos, livestreamed nature walks, more art, better gear, etc...

"Millions of dollars are being spent on NFt avatars, some of which are useless and currently scarce, but I believe that once the metaverse arrives, everyone will have their own NFT avatar, and the frenzy will be real. Metaverse will push the boundaries of blockchain-based video games and Web3, bringing multiplayer games closer to reality. In the metaverse, anyone with a digital avatar can play immersive video games. Players can also earn non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as a reward, which will help the gaming economy grow.  It necessitates a significant amount of effort due to its one-of-a-kind nature and metaverse-based nature. The possibilities, I tell you, are endless. Despite the bear market, there is still a lot of interest in Bayc and cryptopunks, and social media integrations with the profile pic thing are still popular. I believe avatars will play a significant role in the next trend cycle of the NFT sector, but the real question is whether everyone can afford these expensive avatars. With social media behemoths like instagram(meta) joining the fray today, the NFT phenomenon has exploded. Here's how I believe NFT and blockchain tools will become a part of our daily lives as adoption approaches!!  Currently, I'm discussing NFT avatars. On Twitter, we've already seen how to use your nft photo as your profile picture. Only Twitter blue users have access to this feature, and the nft image chosen will be hexagonal in shape. NFTs and metaverse are nearly interchangeable terms. One of the reasons for this is the explosion of NFTs in blockchain gaming. Many people who believe virtual worlds will be used to manifest the metaverse see interoperable games as a natural fit.  I'm curious to see if this is just a fad or if it will gain traction in the months ahead!! Some might argue that these avatars are overpriced simply because they include a profile picture. However, I believe that there are sufficient tools on the market, such as NFT avatar maker, to create custom nft avatars for a reasonable price.  I'd like to hear your thoughts on the NFT avatar craze!!",0.9927,0.026,0.831,0.142

"Hey everyone!  Here is my first NFT collection, they are up for sale on OpenSea.  [https://opensea.io/collection/nfdonuts](https://opensea.io/collection/nfdonuts)  The NFTs are ERC-721 tokens, minted on Polygon.  It is a smaller collection of only 908 unique NFTs.  Right now they are just artwork but if I end up selling enough of them I'd like to create a web application with some kind of reward system and possibly a game or user interface.  This was mostly just a learning experience for me but I would like to make the most of it.  The images were created using Blender and rendered with Eevee.  I keyframed all the different combinations and rendered an animation; each frame being a PNG of a different donut.  I used Visual Basic to create the JSON metadata files, and [pinata.com](https://pinata.com) to upload the images and metadata to an international server.  I used studio 721 to generate a smart contract.  I used Polygon's web application to create the API, verify the contract address, and finally mint all the tokens.  This project required a moderate amount of technical expertise for someone who is not a programmer.  I am not an expert programmer, but I do work with computer systems so many of these things were familiar to me.  Here is a video that helped me out a lot while doing this project:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG4Rjx64bTY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG4Rjx64bTY)  Any way, let me know if you guys have any feedback and/or suggestions.  This was my first project and there are some obvious errors.  Also, I wish I had done a better job with the artwork.  I'm sure it's fine, but after working with it all week long I now notice a few things I wish I had done differently.  Either way I would still like to know what people think.

"I have been interested in blockchain developments for a while now and I had been monitoring crypto markets to see when I can get in on the action. Until i came across NFTs earlier this year and my mind keep exploding with things that the blockchain can be used by businesses. I mean actually exploding, I cant look at businesses anymore in the normal way I used to look at them. I start thinking about how the NFTs will help this business grow. The more I think about it, the more I read articles and learn, the mre I want to do something about this desire to build something inside me. I talked to my closest friends and even my girlfriend about this. My girlfriend didnt know much about it but I appreciate her for listening and even contributing. My friends on the other hand dont seem to see what I see, they seem to be stuck on the negatives like volatility of crypto, rug pulls and the intrusion into the market. I really want to do something, but I need a team (teams make everything better in my opinion). Exchange ideas, learn from each other, knowing that we are invested into this mentally for the long term and were here to stay just how the blockchain is. I know im still very new to this and theres a whole worlds worth of knowledge i do not have...yet, and itll take time. I havnt even talked to my family about this because they have already made it clear that they dont want to talk about the blockchain world and crypto.  Man sometimes i hate these guys for being a little close minded, I presented a business model that revolves around NFTs and they said that its complicated, but 5 mins later one of them wants to start making a 3D printer from scratch. Why dont I have the heart in me to cave his head in I will never understand. Maybe I dont have the convincing power that it takes to bring people on board, idk.  I honestly dont know what to do, I need people I can trust and build with, that is why I talked to my friends. Maybe they need to research further into it to see what I mean. That would mean they need to have that interest in order to put in the effort to research, which they dont seem to be having. I havnt given up on them but I really dont know what to do.  I apologise for any spelling errors or grammatical errors. Thanks for reading and any advice would be greatly appreciated.",0.9929,0.04,0.818,0.143
"Howdy Traveler! The Metaverse Station is a server where we post daily researches about projects we find, be it a p2e game, or an art nft collection!   The researches are JPEG images with all useful info we can find from said project, tokenomics, vesting, devs, scam chance etc, all this in a single place so you can save time.  We keep track of all the projects we researched and post about important updates they make. We have many other features but these are the ones worth mentioning to not make the post too long.   My plans for this community aren't only to post these things, I want to make it an actual place where people can hang out, chill, learn and even hire other people if they need something done (artists, musicians, programmers, etc), as well as invest and evolve together, I honestly feel like the NFT space as a whole is falling apart, and wanted to talk with other people to see what they think about it, if it's really going downhill or if there is still faith.  If you made it this far...thanks! I really appreciate it, this is a personal project and I have many plans for it, I am already working on some interesting things behind the scenes for the medium term future, so hopefully everything goes right!  Please join and give us feedback, suggest researches etc, also feel open to talking with me and the other members about whatever through DMs or Voice Chat, everytime I'm researching a project I join the voice channel in our server!

"   Dear ladies and gentlemen, I want to introduce you to our collection. We do it together, all on our own, without investing in promotion. We are childhood friends and we are united by one common idea. We really love the works of our youth, movies, games, comics and cartoons. We would really not want the old heroes to be forgotten and new ones come in their place, around which HYPE was simply inflated. There will be 512 hand-drawn rats in our collection, everyone will be able to find a character he loves or who is close to him in spirit. We don't like generative collections, that's why we have this approach. Also in our collection there are metal pills, they give the owner the opportunity to write to us and we will create the character he asks. The description of our NFTs is filled with memes, our reasoning and just different things, read it carefully.

"I cannot lie this is my first post on reddit, and I'm not really sure what to do, but I'm giving it a try.

There is nothing special, and no add-ons like a secret comedy club you can get into by owning them.

Connect with the music you love and collect what your favorite artists mint.  **Built For the Future**  Migration to the privacy centric NFM blockchain you can guarantee that you won't be censored or shut down.  **Bonding Curve Economy**  Tokenize yourself into a 1/1 NFT that issues secondary tokens.

"Hey everyone, fresh to this sub!  If i’m entirely honest i’m more of a reddit lurker, not much of a poster. Trying to become more active on that front.  I’ve been into crypto circa 2016/2017 so this hopefully won’t be a super basic set of questions. i’m more than comfortable with blockchains, tokenisation, coins and the various problems they attempt to solve etc. However, I must admit until this week i’ve not really paid any interest to NFTs.   I guess what saying is that i’m just dipping my toes into the NFT world. But, i’d like to think i’m not entirely smooth brained, I’ve got some wrinkles (some).  Now, I believe I get the general concept; You tokenise a set of collectible assets onto a blockchain (Ethereum, Polygon etc) and people collect and bid/swap/trade/invest in them as with many other tokens. I believe i’m all good up until this point. My questions are:  1. Are their any examples of NFT’s that other than having the intrinsic value people give them due to their desirability/rarity etc, do any real utility? (E.g. I read somewhere that Mutant Ape Yacht Club gets you into celeb boat parties, but I call bullshit on that). Any real world examples would be interesting to know.  2. Once the companies/creators behind these NFTs mint them onto the blockchain, do they lose all control/ownership of those assets?  I guess i’m asking the counterintuitive question of does any remaining form of “centralised”control/redaction/removal of these collections once minted and distributed across a decentralised blockchain like Ethereum?   3. From some of the initial collections i’ve browsed on rarity tools and then checked out the company/team web page/socials. Most of them appear to be lazy, cheap cash grabs. Are there any other good examples of NFT creators that are doing anything more than this?  I appreciate this one is a bit of a naive question, but my cynical mind couldn’t see any other driving factors for creating NFTs (other than if you’re a genuine artists/creator).   4. Is OpenSea the place to buy NFTs directly from the creators? I’ve obviously been looking on rarity tools and OpenSea to get more of a clearer image on things. It wasn’t clear to me if people use OpenSea to access an NFT collection when it drops, or if that’s effectively just a marketplace for existing owners.  I’ve done a bit of my own research, still plenty to read up on. So if you also have any good links as well as your own input to things that may cover some of this ground i’d be grateful.",0.9935,0.042,0.803,0.155

It will be an investigation of the understanding of value and is structured in 3 main parts, which are in turn separated in also 3 parts each.  **MAIN PART I**  So in the *ACT I of MAIN PART I*, you mint the OG NFT, it is like a ""fragment"". it will be unlimited mintable, but only for 3 days. you can purchase one or more at one transaction, and based on the total of fragments minted you will recieve different sets of OG NFTs. A fragment is a placeholder NFT, which will present its inlayed information later.  *ACT II of MAIN PART I* features an automatic rewarding system for the following  (X) individuals who purchased the most OG NFTs at the end of day 3. they will recieve them automaticly, without any further payment needed.   *ACT III of MAIN PART I* features an extra rewarding system with 3 ""GODLIKE"" NFT, which will be given by specific criteria. there are only this 3 and they all have a secret ""one-use-only""-action for MAIN PART II, which will be not revealed until MAIN PART II is released.  **MAIN PART II**  *ACT I of MAIN PART II* will bring the Holder of an OG NFT to the scratch: hang on the OG NFT, or trade it for an unknown new, clearly other peace of information. If you decide to ""burn"" your OG NFT, it will be swapped with the new peace of information. Your OG will be irreversible deleted, the hidden information is lost.  *ACT II of MAIN PART II* will reveal the information you are hodling. Your HODLd NFT in your Wallet will update and you will see another ""piece of a puzzle"" (not actual lol), which can be used for something. But at this time you do not know for whta. HODL or sell, its your turn.  *ACT III of MAIN PART III* will devide the HODlers into 2 groups, the HODLers of OGs and of New NFTs. the story will begin now, the HODLer benefits are kicking in from this moment. but they are different for each group, and they won´  t know till the moment they had already made a decicion.  P:S as an reminder, you are able to hold more than one OG NFT.  **MAIN PART III**  Here is my question to you all lovely beings: me and my team have a wonderfull development for the third part, including 8 different HODLer Benefits, Collaborations whith other big players and the really necessary: the ""riddle"" itself, which can only be solved with teamwork and responsibility. Which FUNCTIONS, BENEFITS and EVOLVINGS are you wishing for in such a project like this? what are your expactations, what can we do for you?

"    The competitive gaming market keeps growing day by day, and day after day I can’t say I am surprised. In fact, as a gamer myself, I like the direction it is taking. In fact, I like even more so the direction it is making towards gaming NFTs and games in general.   I went on board the bandwagon with Axie Infinity and made a lot of money back then and I am glad. I am now on board Kitty Kart which I play with my friends religiously and that too is an insanely fun game.   What I really like is the fact that I can make a living off playing games and having fun. Literally just doing what I do best. Better yet, in the crypto world itself. Where I feel like I belong the most.   It’s like the two most things I like, crypto and gaming, got aggregated into one. And I am so glad for that. This has a huge future later on and I just know it. I just know this will peak big and I am so bullish.   The competitiveness of the gaming industry has righteously carried well into the NFT industry with these NFT games, and I am happy to be here when it happened.",0.9937,0.0,0.749,0.251
"I believe that the NFT community has a huge opportunity to help charity and make the world a better place. Especially when it comes to young people, to inspire them and improve them as well. If you ask me, I think that in many ways, you can use NFTs to help someone in one way or another, to fulfill some of their dreams maybe (many teenagers are living a dream by working with NFTs)     As long as I've known myself the football clubs, as well as individual football players, have actively participated in charitable activities with or without UNICEF's assistance by helping young people and children and raising awareness among them about the value of sport and the quality of life.     I'm happy to know that today many sports NFT marketplaces/projects actively invest money in young athletes by selling NFTs which was almost impossible 5y ago.     They give them opportunities for personal development, training and most importantly, to fulfill their dreams. So far I've heard that K-Club NFT plan to do and if that's the case then we have an entire new way of participation in football or let's say evolution.      As a Football Manager game fan (playing since 2004) there is something that totally amazed me and changed my perception or let's say possibly gave us (regular fans) an opportunity to participate in club's decision in real life. It looks like that you as a holder, for example, will be directly involved in transfer decisions, trainer decisions and board decisions. You become like a part of a club, man, it really took me time to catch up on this information and see did I understood well because that's awesome! I don't think that I've heard of something like this before!      The part about helping young football players is really great, but this other moment really blew my mind! Are there more projects like this one? This one really made my day. I'm so curious now to see if anything similar exists and how they gonna develop.",0.9938,0.0,0.807,0.193

"When I first heard of NFT tickets I thought okay that are some tickets for metaverse only right? But no, I mean there are metaverse event tickets as well but this is not about that, this refers to real-life events such as concerts, festivals, and various types of events.     I was so curious that I start searching for answers, this is one of the best possible solutions made over a blockchain network. So what's the deal? It's pretty simple, I'm sure you will love all these benefits also.      First and foremost, are you aware of the enormous issues that ticketing faces today, such as counterfeiting, bad actors, pervasive fraud, and, most importantly, fragmentation? For example, what I found out on NFT TiX is that when a major ticketing company issues a ticket, it may be bought and sold several times on secondary marketplaces. All of these issues are resolved through NFT tickets.     Control over secondary market sales might be considered to be one of the most essential advantages supplied by NFT tickets, especially when ticket resellers continue to buy thousands of event tickets to resale at obscene prices.     So, they have a really good reason to develop these types of tickets, that move is reasonable and fans would have so many benefits with these tickets but we will talk about it some other time. So, what do you think, do you have some of yours pros and cons?   [ Diagram showing all the processes that occur for a blockchain transaction to occur. Every new ticket owner is assigned a fresh wallet address on the fly, this address will be the owner of the NFT. After a successful mint the ticketeers backend is provided the location of the NFT. This will allow ticket holders to view their smart ticket ‘on chain’ in the near future! ](https://preview.redd.it/xsz5nn0c4zl81.png?width=1082&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10d97ccd7e4e3943eaec831744226e7ef428ee84)",0.9939,0.051,0.758,0.192
"[Terra Virtua](https://terravirtua.io) is a sustainable Metaverse platform offering unique social, gaming and creative experiences. I got to know about it on Twitter and realised they also recently got on reddit r/TerraVitrua.  Looked into its marketplace, seemed simple and not so attractive until i explored further the 'recent sold' section. The place, as it turned out, is filled with legit collectors seemingly interested in stuff ranging from Art, vFlects to blockchain gaming utilities.  So, here's what i think is working for TV despite being oblivious to almost 95% of the Metaverse enthusiasts.   • ui is easy to understand and navigate through  So, as a beginner you wouldn't face any problems navigating your way to getting an overall understanding of how things work in the platform. No neon glowing showy fancy burst of colors almost every mouse click, instead keeping it simple yet elegant. ___  • has a dedicated blog that explains most of the stuff regularly  The platform actually runs its own blog and one that is active and explains a lot about upcoming drops, perks, the rarity system etc. It also puts the original creator of the collectibles, whether an artist or a corporate entity, its due credits. ___  • supports artists  Terra Virtua has a dedicated artist program through which artists can start earning at 0 investment (no gas fee, no two time fee when u try to sell your works, everything is handled by TV, you the artist just need to immerse in your art completely. Feel this is important if you're trying to incorporate new faces into your platform, and specifically artists who want to get into the NFT art space but don't know where or how to start, since it can be overwhelmingly hard to understand, at times, for conventional artists and digital artists alike. ___  • active participation in charity and fund collection for social causes.   During my time i started following, i saw the [platform donate 100% of its sale proceeding to DonorsChoose](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.avclub.com/the-internet-eats-itself-as-stephen-colberts-aft-become-1848574712/amp) when it collaborated with The Late Show host Stephen Colbert to come up with [his vFlects](https://terravirtua.io/marketplace/avtr_scnft_a_w) in the [TV Marketplace](https://terravirtua.io/marketplace/)  It's based on Polygon blockchain now doing its part in keeping it sustainable. TV cares more than what other random marketplaces do at the moment about the socio-economic worries looming all over the globe, in my opinion. This is not to disregard what the other marketplaces are doing to help out lives in need of aid. ___  • official licensed collectibles   Most of the collectibles are official licenced products featuring the likes of Godzilla vs Kong, Pacific Rim, ISL, Nitro League,  Bored Ape vFlects etc and world renowned artists Nick Percival, JTD, Ross Golan etc adorn the standards of the galleries and the marketplace. This, re-establishing faith and the standards of the platform. ___  • The TV METAVERSE   Terra Virtua has been working on creating a virtual world, for us all to experience and be a part of  where we would be able to have meetings, chill hangout hubs, roam and mess around in...Explore virtual outlets, mini-games. This is how it was always supposed to be. The collectibles you own are already all metaverse ready, and as such will be integrated into the metaverse when its out! ___  • TV has its own token $TVK   It's available (Binance, AscendEx, Uniswap) which does have certain utilities &amp; advantages for staking, even has a 'Prestige Club' for the token that offers a lot of perks if you're a part of it. Not a shitcoin, again. ___  • Active communities building up in every major platform.  Not just this, the Dev team and Marketing teams make sure the users get spoilt by new features and collaborations almost every week or two. ___   So, these are some points which i would like the up and coming marketplaces to integrate. Also, the fact that Terra Virtua is now going mainstream implies the platform is all set to meet the expectations of new users hopping into its journey of creating the Metaverse we all believe can we explored with collectibles/avatars/vFlects we own.",0.994,0.028,0.863,0.108
""" Recently, former legendary boxer George Floyd and beauty mogul Kim Kardashian West got sued by investors that alleged they had been scammed by the two into buying crypto coins called EthereumMax.   Now, if you're a crypto nerd you know how painful and frustrating it is to make losses on your investments, regardless of the amount, especially after hours and hours of futile research. I can wager my last coin, however, that these 'investors' would be the first to praise the duo if their investments bore fruits.  Crypto is full of hypocrites who've always been following steps treaded by influential figures in the space, such as Elon Musk, and this is definitely not a healthy trend.  In simple terms, in this space, it's always good until it goes against you. Donald Trump said Cryptocurrencies are dangerous to the world economy, but was the first to praise his wife's NFT project.   I wonder if Trump's supporters are smart enough to figure out how to buy NFTs, but for people with such an amount of influence in their hands, it is very easy to make ungodly amounts of money with very minimal effort. This is hypocritical as Crypto promises to liberate the monetary system from the powerful, but instead, functions only to make the wealthy wealthier. This vision, however, can only be realised if more and more people get into crypto.   To make it as an individual investor in this space, you need to do tons and tons of research, but if that's not your thing, find yourself a trustworthy CEX to trade on your behalf.  One such platform you can trust to manage your investments is Aggregated Finance (AGFI). This is a platform that stands for leading the world onto decentralized investment as a Defi-as-a-service approach. It is a Defi 3.0 based project that bets on the success of the entire ecosystem by making strategic investments on behalf of all it's holders and rewards them by buybacks and reflections.

"My friend is kinda obsessed when it comes to traveling and he mostly chooses the best possible hotel that can offer him all the luxuries he can get, sometimes I think that hotel and everything that goes with it, what it can provide makes him more excited than the traveling itself or a country he picked to visit.     One night we drank some wine, discuss NFTs and all the trading we have done in the last few years and he came upon an idea that we could do some research and find NFTs that can provide luxurious staying at hotels, spa centers, expensive meals, and many more.      At first, we didn't find anything, so I thought that not exactly everything can be bought through NFTs as I thought before but after we couple of hours online looking for a perfect combo, we ran across an amazing project, it's not a surprise they call it a godlike platform or platform for NFT drop by the gods, for the gods, it was so original, loved it!     I would be happy to share with you guys because this is something brand new in the NFT world that provides us all that luxury when we're on vacation, the project we have found is called Last Hopium, I hope that you will have fun exploring it and that it would be useful for you.

"""  So, your plan to build your crypto empire has failed, what now… Well, the choice is clear, you can either keep going, fight through the rapids, or give on everything you have struggled to build and just. Let. Go.   These are the toughest times in crypto, and those who pull through will be the ones victorious in the end. It’s the toughest to struggle against sinking well all hope for staying afloat is gone. But be sure my friend, I am here to reassure you, there is still hope in a brighter future.   You can ask anyone who trades regularly, crypto or other. Markets crash all the time. It is not the fault of the market in itself, but the fault of the system it was built on. A system of borrow and repay, everyone borrows, the field are green and the sky is clear. Come repay time, no one wants to pay back, so the gov just creates credit out of thin air and clears your name. All good yes? No. This is why markets fall.  So what does this mean for you and me? The ones who do not own a country. Well, for starters it means we should be extra wary at time of trouble, and be assured of another rise in the markets after the storm. The best thing to do right now is to let everything rest and recover on its own.   In the meantime what you can do, is buy into smaller projects. Large projects like BTC are going into a downward spiral and need significant time to get back up, so it’s best to leave it as is and focus on something else. Look into the smaller market and get yourself some Royal Falcons Club or something.   Market crashes are normal and bound to happen at one point or another. So just let it happen and buy into something else. """,0.9941,0.067,0.741,0.192

"Hi Redditors,  I'm incredibly excited to announce a project that has been years in the making, at least in my mind, haha! But, unfortunately, I never found the time to take it to the next level!  Today I feel ready to take it to the next level!  **Welcome to Gods Don't Fall**  &gt;The Realm of Gods is slowly rotting. Gods are lost in their endless existence living empty and meaningless lives. The only means of entertainment; the legendary tournament, where challengers from all realities came together to entertain the old gods, vying to become one themselves.

The goal is to kick your opponents from the platform. The higher the damage they receive, the further you kick them away!  The game is very casual and easy to start! However, you can find incredible depth and esports potential through the frame-by-frame combat system!  **Frame system:**      The total number of frames :     1. Anticipation Frames-AF: number of frames before impact (collision)     2. Collision Frames-CF: start of collision detection (impact)     3. Recovery Frames-RF: number of frames needed before initiating any other action     4. Additional Recovery Frames-ARF: are the number of frames added to RF when     you fail to complete the following Hit/Combo. (exp: +2 Additional RF after you fail 3rd combo)          When a collision happens in CF;     Impact Frames-IF:     Total number of frames*     1. Perfect Frame-PF*: is located at the 1st frame of IF (exp). the closer the next button     press lands according to the location of PF the more BF are gained.     [+1]←←←[+2]←←←Perfect Frame [+3]→→→[+2]→→→[+1]     2. Bonus Frames/Frame Advantage -BF: BF is calculated by how close you are     to PF. The more you get, the more you have access to more combos. BF is calculated when you finish the combo.  **Business Model:**  My idea is to charge NFT holders and projects to integrate their characters into the game! The funding will be used to:  1. Fund the game development 2. Marketing / Content Creation / Live Streaming 3. Tournaments / Esports 4. Profits will be distributed to  * Gods Don't Fall Pass holders * IP holder of the different NFT communities * Players that play the game (Scholarship)  I'd love to get some feedback from the community and optimize based on that!  I hope GDF excites you as much as it does excite me to see it here finally!

"A few months ago I was scrolling over my IG to kill some time as everyone does sometimes. After a couple of good scrolls, I ended up at the store of IG-users and I saw something that caught my attention.   Artworks from Criss Bellini !   Honestly, just as you are thinking right now, I had no clue who or what Criss Bellini was. So, as a good investigator I looked up his name on Google and ended up at the website of this Swedish artist (I am reffering to Criss himself) which is selling amazing artwork on high museum quality paper with over 100 years of guarantee, original certificats and stamps of Criss Bellini. A sold-out is really sold-out situation with no restocks.   Eventhough this was enough to make me a fan of his creative work and his paintings which are showing the world - as in my opinion - is in todays daily life. To be specific the painting PRBLM CHLD which show a child holding up a paper saying: ""School kills creativity"" hit me right in the heart. Just because this is the reality which I can comprehend.   As a real NFT'r would do, I immedialty looked up his name on OpenSea.io and found the Criss Bellini Original Files and apparently it is even possible to buy a 1 of 1 NFT completed with the psychical version of your NFT which you receive at your home if you are the first buyer.   After some research and a few weeks/months following Criss Bellini his IG account (@CrissBellini) I saw they started a new project called the Iconic Mavericks. A simple but amazing project based on real Iconic figures from the present and past. This was the part were I was curious about since it was quiet a cryptic post regarding the newest project.  As said as done I immediatley joined the Dis Cord server and after a few quick verifications steps I ended up in the most incredible community I ever been in. The kind people in the server helped me understand a lot of the project and how it worked.   Ofcourse, as every project they work with a ""special guest list"" and just the open sale on OpenSea.io. There will be a total of 8884 NFT's. To get on this ""Special Guest List"" - which is only for 2000 persons - you simply have to be part of the community. Currently there are 59 members on the ""Special Guest list"" and rising. There a few other ways you can take to get on the ""Special Guest List"" such as: • Join the games on Dis Cord • Join the gift games in the server • Buy a NFT on OpenSea of the Original Files • Many more you should discover on the server.   This is a project you can not miss and really should be a part of. You will find a few sneak peeks at there Twitter account which is added in the URL's, ofcourse if you join the Dis Cord Server you can see them as one the first ones.   Those URL's might be usefull for you:    (Remove the space between the Dis and Cord) • Disc.

"It's shocking to find out that out of all the NFT projects out there, only 16% can be traced back to female artists. I feel women should have a stronger voice in this space and I wanted to showcase some of my favorite projects that I have either invested in or enjoyed watching them grow.    **World of Women**  World of Women has taken the NFT space by storm! Not only is it a popular collection focused on women, but it has also become one of the most popular collections, period. The collection is composed of 10,000 women, which represent diversity and power. Yam Karkai is the powerhouse behind this collection and her mission was simple, highlight and empower women by making them the centerpiece of her art.   **Crypto Coven**   Another amazing female-centric NFT collection we see in the space is Crypto Coven. This super unique collection of 9,999 witches on the blockchain. Each witch falls under a different categorization of power: ​​Enchantress, Hag, Mage, Necromancer, Occultist, Seer. Crypto Coven is an immersive, narrative-driven experiment in world-building with each witch being a character that you can utilize within the worlds.   **Sad Girl Bar**  Another interesting project we see putting ladies at the forefront is Sad Girls Bar, a collection of 10,000 NFTs of women that, according to the project’s creators, are hand-drawn &amp; drown in sadness. The Sad Girls are more than just NFTs though, they are meant to bring awareness to mental health. The team has donated 10 ETH in support of Women Side by side, the alliance for women and girls at risk.   **Crypto.Chicks**  This collection's purpose was very simple, to highlight the importance of women in the crypto space.  They pioneered the way for so many of these other projects, giving women the spotlight in a male-dominated world. In addition to donating to women empowerment projects, Crypto.Chicks also offer a monthly blog series that features women NFT artists from around the world with interviews about their stories and their work.   **Nudie Community**  This collection was made to empower all women in the space and provide a voice for women creators and artists. The collection consisted of 10,000 nudie cats that were vibrant and super cool. The team was devoted to building an authentic community that was inclusive and held substance. I was involved in their community and really felt it promoted what WAGMI should be. They also devote a portion of secondary sale royalties to various women's charities.      Drop any other amazing female-led projects that you have purchased or found of interest! let's give women the voice they deserve! #WAGMI",0.9945,0.062,0.775,0.163
I kinda don’t like how discussions about NFT games are always so profit centered.  Yes profits are a big part of NFT gaming but they’re not the only thing to consider.  I think it’s a little understandable since there still aren’t that many entertaining but still profitable NFT games.  I stick to both Sandbox and Legends of Elumia cause I feel like they have the best ratio between enjoyment and profit.  What’s good though is that we’re starting to see some projects like ENGN work on introducing popular games from the real world into the NFT universe so lets hope we see more projects like this one pop up more.,0.9945,0.0,0.632,0.368
"The charts look crazy right now!   How do you know when to buy during turblent times in the crypto/nft space?  If you are a pro investor or an expert trader, then you probably have an excellent strategy that works for you regardless of an up or down market.  If you aren't, you're probably reading this because you are trying to find one.   When the market is choppy like it is currently, it's can be tough to know wether to buy or sell. One influencer is saying load up and prepare for $100k [\#Bitcoin](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/bitcoin?__eep__=6&amp;__cft__[0]=AZUdg5NvZsis0yi-MuAt2xHyNg9HdcE9aBh4YtPmsHx8LQdptKtyYzvlw5KQF-Qz8vvRaYadItMszvAs0IDnrnx0rQfTqUpTcUox0YyvAQC4sXY0tBzDOe8svzLRzPnU4IJCnF3DbfQBaw1aq-GICpfw&amp;__tn__=*NK-R) and another is telling you to sell everything because the bear market has officially started.  Between charts, news, and influence, it can be hard to know what to do in times like these.  It's easy to invest confidently when everything is going up. Just throw you pay check at whatever, take profits, and look like a hero. If that is your overall strategy, YOU WILL BE REKT when the market starts to chop.   I see it all the time with rookies. It always works till it doesn't.  If you aren't an expert, a basic strategy for succes is to watch the news, follow the influencers, study the charts, and learn how to leverage them to your advantage.   HOWEVER, while you are educating yourself, throw all those things out while you are building your investing strategy.  Yeah, you heard me right. Don't worry about any of the things everyone else is using to make money in the blockchain space.   At this point, all that stuff is going to do is overload you with information and have you going in circles until you've made a bad decision.  To start with, the foundation for success, is spotting solid projects. If you don't know how to spot solid projects, find a Crypto/NFT mentor with a proven track record who can give you guidance.   Find 2-3 projects that you are ok with holding for 2-3 years if the market crashes tomorrow.   Next, determine an amount of coins, tokens, or NFTs you would like to accumulate.   Then, come up with an amount of money you are willing to invest into the projects weekly/monthly.   At that point, you are going to Dollar Cost Average(DCA) into these projects.   This can be harder with NFTs because maybe you can't afford the NFT of your choice with your initial funds, but this will still work for you, stay with me...  Here's where this plan really takes shape though and you actually start looking forward to this dips and/or bear markets:  Leave 25% of your desired investment amount in a stable coin like USDC. For example, If I invest $100/week, I'm putting $25 in project A, $25 in project B, $25 in project C, and leaving $25 in USDC.  Now, when the dip or bear market comes, you have funds ready and you are able to take full advantage of your buying power.   This is how it really helps with NFTs too. When the crypto market dips, the NFT market generally follows.   Not only are you getting a discount on the NFT you have been waiting to buy(and you better move quick, because people like me wait for these opportunites), you are able to buy more of the assest you need to buy said NFT.   It's a win-win.   Most projects I'm in, I am super long on(unless I move into something for trading or yeild farming purposes).  When friends call me freaking out about the market, I generally have to ask the price. Once you operate like this, the [\#Metaverse](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/metaverse?__eep__=6&amp;__cft__[0]=AZUdg5NvZsis0yi-MuAt2xHyNg9HdcE9aBh4YtPmsHx8LQdptKtyYzvlw5KQF-Qz8vvRaYadItMszvAs0IDnrnx0rQfTqUpTcUox0YyvAQC4sXY0tBzDOe8svzLRzPnU4IJCnF3DbfQBaw1aq-GICpfw&amp;__tn__=*NK-R) becomes much easier to navigate.

" Recently NFTs have been getting an increasing amount of hate, due to the number of cash grabs and scams. The post below  last week went viral on twitter with over 200k likes. However, NFTs have many applications, in this post I will explore the utillity of NFT ticketing    https://preview.redd.it/pkwtct60o1h81.png?width=404&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=469850496f5568ab453529398332c0dfbdbe46ae   **NFTs are more than JPEGs, but what is an NFT?**   &gt; “ NFTs are a simple set of blockchain standards that enable **genuine ownership** in a way that is interoperable, re-mixable, and secure. For the first time, users can now genuinely own digital objects. - Chris Dixon    This makes NFTs an excellent usecase for ticketing, gaming and art. Coachella, the Super bowl and number of other high profile events have been experimenting with NFT ticketing.     https://preview.redd.it/uap44j09p1h81.png?width=236&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ffd9e734c2fbfac4d34874029750343c8174b65     **What are the current problems in the ticketing industry?**  **1.** **No immediate validation**  Attendees cannot easily verify if their tickets are valid (Tackmann, 2017).  **2.** **Lack of Transparency**  A lack of transparency in the secondary market is evident in the event ticketing industry (Waterson, 2016). Event organizers do not have an ownershiptrail, which shows if intermediaries  **3.** **Lack of trust:**  Consumers have to trust third parties when buying tickets on secondary markets and thus face the risk of purchasing fraudulent or invalidated tickets, that face the risk of being cancelled or are counterfeits. Furthermore, event organizers have to trust ticketing companies that they sell all tickets on primary market and not keeping a portion for themselves to sell tickets at a high mark-up straight to the secondary market. Like Ticketmaster's secret scalping program  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-HCqL38WdY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-HCqL38WdY)  **4.** **No control over secondary markets:**  Consumers ticket prices on secondary markets are taken to extremes, partially through the use of bots which automatically drive up prices to earn a profit by reselling them at the highest possible markups (Courty, 2017). From the event organizer’s point of view, a major problem is the limited control over secondary transactions.  5. **Dependence on intermediaries:**  Event organizers are dependent on intermediaries and bear financial risks while being cut off from windfall profits and direct relations with event attendees.    **How do NFT tickets solve these problems?**  On a public blockchain the ticket buyer can immdiately verify if the ticket is the original one. Consumers do not have to trust intermediaries anymore, but can instead verify if the ticket is real. A public blockchain is transparent. Event organizers and ticket buyers can check the ownership trail. This gains valuable insight in the transfers of tickets in secondary markets and can be used for future marketing opportunity’s. The event organizer can also check if ticketmaster is secretely selling a portion of the ticket directly on secondary like in the example above. A smart contract can prevent the resale of tickets or include the a royalty fee for artist. This is similar to NFT art, where a royalty is often included.  Other Benefits are that the NFT ticket can be used to for continuous engagement of the artist with fans even after the event.  Artists get the tools to use NFT tickets for community building and fan engagement. Think of NFT tickets giving access to special community places or even being used for governance, where fans can vote on what they want in future shows.      https://preview.redd.it/is4wolkfp1h81.png?width=359&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b709cf3bd74a3515b3b9d77ddd1ed9135c5dc793   **In the case of Coachella the the NFt ticket gives the following benefits**     https://preview.redd.it/aswj3d5ip1h81.png?width=535&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=182e57886cf78711e8fe9fdaca372996fb5cbe74     **DeFi event financing**  A very interesting use case of tickets being NFTs is that still needs to be explored further is using DeFi to provide upfront funding of eventsThe NFT tickets can be used as collateral for event financing. In the future you should be able to invest in artists/shows of your preference by buying NFT tickets upfront and earning from them after they’ve gone on sale\*\*.\*\*  **This blog goes into more detail.**  [**https://medium.com/get-protocol/decentralizing-event-financing-liquidity-x-defi-x-nfts-975f028135f5**](https://medium.com/get-protocol/decentralizing-event-financing-liquidity-x-defi-x-nfts-975f028135f5)      https://preview.redd.it/p8knfrhlp1h81.png?width=430&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04e98aa33d6f92ca4df3d5567b9c8b48abaa3de2     **NFT tickets in practice**  I bough an NFT tickets using GUTS a GET protocol powered NFT ticketing solution  For mass adoption the purchase of ticket needs to be frictionless, the blockchain part needs to happen in the background. To test this I bough a ticket for a show of Max Cooper in London.You buy your ticket with fiat money and check-out like you have always done. Everything else happens in the background. You don’t need an Ethereum wallet or any knowledge about blockchain/crypto whatsoever to buy a ticket\*\*.\*\*  [**https://guts.events/yrwilh-max-cooper/lezoiu**](https://guts.events/yrwilh-max-cooper/lezoiu)      https://preview.redd.it/cpl3rhtnp1h81.png?width=506&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e12c49a16aa8ea242f2f486963d2ee061aedbf6f     I can verify the authenticity of the ticket on the NFT ticket Explorer  [**https://explorer.get-protocol.io/**](https://explorer.get-protocol.io/)      https://preview.redd.it/am7gcprpp1h81.png?width=359&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3e77738d17f468d873b6af80a114132f922fc27     **Claiming you NFT ticket to your wallet**  Claiming a ticket as an NFT is an “after the event” possbillity. It isn’t mandatory and only influences the “after the show” experience. I’ll get back to this and the benefits later.  Claiming is done by either copy/pasting your wallet address in the app or scanning the QR-code of it.       https://preview.redd.it/xf190gpsp1h81.png?width=506&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=264c562f66701a809841627129f76e53f26d8a6a     **Opensea**  The ticket I purchased from Max Cooper will only be claimable as an NFT after the event has passed  But here is an example of another GET fueled NFT ticket tradeable on OpenSea:      https://preview.redd.it/tf0sjpyup1h81.png?width=366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a27b9a0d2ea9370193f5e373b3ffafa0c34e881     **Conclusion**  NFTs are much more than just JPEGs and scams. NFTs present an oppurtunity to revolutionize and disrupt industries. NFTs can prevent fraud and scams in the creative industry. An example of an industry that can easily capture the benefits of NFT is the ticketing industry. For mass adoption the purchase and reselling needs to be frictionless and not require any blockchain knowledge. Consumers can already easily buy ticket without having to know anything about crypto. Therefore, I expect that in the near future all tickets are going to be NFTs.  The ticketing industry is already aware of the utillity of NFT. For instance Jack Goetzinger, the CEO of Seatgeek, thinks that in the next 5-10 years all tickets will be an NFT      https://preview.redd.it/pudlua2xp1h81.png?width=359&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ffe74144f72df7301f29a184f49f0a19227091c     **Sources**  [**https://adnanzzz.medium.com/nfts-are-much-more-than-just-jpegs-99c20cd963fd**](https://adnanzzz.medium.com/nfts-are-much-more-than-just-jpegs-99c20cd963fd)  Courty, P.

"Here me out. The first rule says NFT's only, but I think talking about potential ones fall in that category. If not you can take this down, but I feel I'm on to something with this.  So for those who don't know, vTubers are basically animated characters that play games, sing, and chat. They are just like any youtuber, but as an animated girl (mostly).  I think the whole background of vTubers in terms of getting into a company n' such may bloat this post too much, so I will have that.  To give you an example of the popularity that most new ""debuts"" of vtubers in big companies have made it where youtube shuts down their sub count and/or takes away thousands of accounts due to them thinking that they are bot accounts. A major japanese company released their first generation of vtubers and each have gotten around 2-3 million subscribers within the first year.  BUT, what makes them a bit different than other youtubers is the amount of donations they get during live streams. The most popular one's can get $100 or $1,000+ dollars each stream they do. I'm still new to it's community, but I've seen individual $100-$500 donations thrown around like pennies in a fountain. The   So I think there can be something where the two can come together. Someone can be looked at as the  ""landlord"" for a certain period of time where you earn a certain percentage every month of their donations as rent. That others would try to buy out the original landlord simply for the idea of the vtuber living in their apartment complex that may make other vtubers want to live their as well. Heck, owning a theoretical apartment may be something with this. It can also be looked at as becoming their agent, where you have the ability to set-up endorsement deals or make it where the vtuber is playing a game that has ""purchased"" a certain amount of streams or hours streaming. The larger companies have had their vtubers play games that they were basically paid to play and had it like one big advertisement WHILE still getting individual donations.  Now of course the big risk is that major companies will not let anyone do this in their program for now. It would have to be a popular indie, but I feel the first one that becomes popular doing this will make things start to happen.",0.9949,0.006,0.858,0.136
"Making the right choice for investment in today’s world could be a struggle due to the market being flooded with numerous investment options. Every investment sector differs with varying profit earning opportunities depending on diverse factors. NFTs are one of the most popular and rapidly growing parts of the finance industry, offering the opportunity to invest and earn with profit.       NFTs being non-fungible cannot be replaced or exchanged with other assets despite having equivalent values. The uniqueness and rarity of these tokens make them desirable and valuable in the market. NFTs are the representation of unique assets, for example, art, video, image, and many others. Their ownership rights are stored securely on blockchain technology.         **Let’s discuss the benefits of owning the NFTs:**     **Uniqueness:** The ownership rights of an NFT can be transferred to only one person, therefore, others cannot claim the ownership or copyright over the tokenized asset unless the owner decides to sell it to someone else.        **Collectibles:** The unique nature of the NFT is one of its essential features that make them valuable. There is no possibility that another NFT with the same properties can exist in the market for sale and that’s what helps NFTs to gain more value over time. Their unique nature makes them perfect to be an option for collectibles.          **Immutable:** The data once stored on blockchain technology is extremely hard to be erased, reversed or altered. Thus, the ownership of the asset recorded on blockchain technology is highly secured and nobody can steal the rights from the owner.   **Decentralized environment:** A creator willing to sell his NFT can sell it directly to a buyer without including a middleman in the entire process. This makes the process faster, easier, and more economical.    If you are among those who want to avail this opportunity to invest in NFTs and gain enormous benefits out of it, you can begin your investment journey by registering yourself with **Novuszilla**.      Novuszilla is [**India’s 1st NFT Marketplace**](https://novuszilla.com/) offering the chance to buy exclusive NFTs being dropped by famous personalities.

"I will try to make this brief but it’s been a roller coaster of emotion the last few months as “Invisible Friends” has completely taken over. Me and my band mate essentially created this name and have been using it as a business for years.   Three years ago me and my band mate created the name “Invisible Friends”. We knew the term “Imaginary Friends” wasn’t original enough and there wasn’t a single other business, band, or artist that used the name ‘Invisible Friends’ for creating some sort of art. We have been releasing music under the name and have been on social media for years. We knew it was an awesome name and that people would catch on. We didn’t expect this to happen though.   The craziest thing of all is that I am the member of the band who wears a helmet and my face appears to be completely invisible. It almost has a similar vibe as the NFT does. It was part of our identity. It’s been my life’s work. We moved to LA from Canada and have put all of our money and effort into making music and essentially being “Invisible Friends”.   We’re both figuring out what we can do. We would love to be apart of the community in some way as now our name is completely tied to this immensely popular NFT collection.   I’ll be the first to say that I love their work. I love the NFT space and the potential that it has, but we really do feel like there are some similarities to the band image that we created, as well as the actual name of course.    I’ve attached some links here to show the imagery with my specific character, as well as our overall brand.   Very curious to see what the community thinks about this!

"Hi guys! I hope that you are all well. I would like to share my story. I am an ordinary student from an ordinary city who is studying to be a psychologist. The fact is that I have a disability of the second degree (there are only three of them in our country). I have it because of poor eyesight (-18), poor hearing (I wear hearing aids) and a cleft palate (I have two palatine tongues that are located in my throat). Due to these features, I have difficulty finding a job, but I really want to buy my mother a new phone, I love her madly and am grateful to her for raising and raising me. I understand how hard it was for her to keep track of me and my health for 21 years.  I could buy this phone for her with my allowance, which the state gives me, but for this I need to do nothing for 8 months.  I really like to order delicious food for myself and my mother with my own money, in our city not everyone can afford it. I also like to go out with my friends. Therefore, considering all these nuances, I will not be able to do nothing for 8 months to buy this phone for her.  Now I tried to upload photos with short stories in NFT format on OpenSea. If you have such an opportunity and means, then I would be extremely happy if you purchased any of this. Then I could please my mother and show that I care.  If everything goes well, then I plan to buy a new tablet for my grandmother (her tablet is very slow and needs to be repaired every month), as well as buy a good phone for my uncle, who has been replacing my father since childhood and helps me and my mother with money, at the moment he has a phone with buttons from Nokia.

"   The 3 most innovative Blockchain projects of our time are Bitcoin, Ethereum, and CryptoKitties.  All 3 of these things have one(well more than one) thing in common. I thought all of them were stupid at one time.   If you're reading this, the first two may seem like blockchain no brainers, while the last one may leave you thinking I only have half a brain.  Give me a chance, though. I've learned that sometimes when I think something is stupid(espcially when I think something is stupid), I need to step back and evaluate the situation from a different perspective.   I can Link that outlook to my biggest [\#crypto](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/crypto?__eep__=6&amp;__cft__[0]=AZX-xz39OaWrGp81lmoO4RTo2WxCuRwuNDWmanTr5TRkqqhxlae2rvb5kQDN0BybaXGJjxGoDOh8K2vWfdWPhSiYptQYKsgHLsHqJ40T-YP4ZhQAZglatgqWfNzqNi_E7QFR5xXEjsllPSIiZ0GbYRaq&amp;__tn__=*NK-R) successes.  Bitcoin has to be at the top of the list. It was the first real cryptocurrency to find success and it was the first blockchain.   Before Bitcoin, outside of small circles, no one was really talking about the viability of a decentralized online ledger that could could be used for peer to peer [\#cash](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/cash?__eep__=6&amp;__cft__[0]=AZX-xz39OaWrGp81lmoO4RTo2WxCuRwuNDWmanTr5TRkqqhxlae2rvb5kQDN0BybaXGJjxGoDOh8K2vWfdWPhSiYptQYKsgHLsHqJ40T-YP4ZhQAZglatgqWfNzqNi_E7QFR5xXEjsllPSIiZ0GbYRaq&amp;__tn__=*NK-R) transfers.  Bitcoin has literally started a digitial revolution that has spread from the internet to the real world.   It has inspired countries like El Salvador to change what it considers money. Literally bringing new life to an underdeveloped country.   Bitcoin has as also inspired coders like Ethereum developer Vitalik Buterin to take blockchain to a new level.   Vitalik built the Ethereum blockchain to where other developers can build on top of the chain using Smart Contracts.  In simplest terms a smart contract is a binding digital agreement that states ""If event A happens, then event B automatically happens.""  As those events happen the whole sequece is updated on the blockchain aka digital ledger.  In the near future, everything from credit, to loans, to repossessions will take place with Smart Contracts on the blockchain.  On top of all that, Ethereum smart contracts not only paved the way for blockchains like BNB and CRO, but also set the foudations for things like decentralized Finance aka DeFi and Play To Earn gaming.   All of which will change how we operate in the modern world.  Now, Crypto Kitties... How did these dumb cats change the digital world?   Well, Crypto Kitties was the first NFT ever. Not only did the cats  pave the path for NFTs, very few people know that it was technically the very P2E game ever.  When I first heard of Digital Art, I thought it was stupid and would never catch on.   At that point, I never considered the added value it could provide to smart contracts.   From an artist stand point, it elimitantes the biggest problem most Artist have which is needing to continually produce and sell new Artwork.  With NFTs, we now know that Artists can have it coded into the smart contract that after every resell, a percetange of the trascaction goes back to the Artist wallet.   Imagine if Picasso still had a percentage of every transaction going back to his family. If he had a NFT, it would be possible.  CryptoKittes inspired all of the current NFTs to an extent and is still more advanced than many of the current Profile Pic projects.   The very first NFT was more than Digital Artwork. It was a Play To Earn game before there was [\#P2E](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/p2e?__eep__=6&amp;__cft__[0]=AZX-xz39OaWrGp81lmoO4RTo2WxCuRwuNDWmanTr5TRkqqhxlae2rvb5kQDN0BybaXGJjxGoDOh8K2vWfdWPhSiYptQYKsgHLsHqJ40T-YP4ZhQAZglatgqWfNzqNi_E7QFR5xXEjsllPSIiZ0GbYRaq&amp;__tn__=*NK-R).  The game, breeding cats, is actually a very complex mix of probability and game theory.   It's not mashing together 2 NFTS like most current NFT breeding projects.   Crypto Kitties have four layers of dominant/recessive genes and chances of mutations to create new traits. All of which alter how the new NFT kitten appears.   There are also contract restrictions to keep family members from breeding and cool down times based on # of breeds.  The NFT project Crypto Kitties was truly ahead of it's time. Now we are seeing P2E Games being further developed and NFTs being integrated into our everyday life.   It took about 12 yrs for countries to adpot Bitcoin. I think it will take 1/3 if that time before several countries have an official NFT.    Bitcoin, Ethereum, and   CryptoKitties have all been hugely influential on not only blockchain, but the world.",0.995,0.027,0.855,0.118
"Hey guys, I just shelled out $3,000 to a good designer to create a 10,000 piece collection. (Pretty much all my savings lol) I’m super excited, but also very inexperienced in the NFT space.  My goal is to create a community that provides as much value as possible to the members. I want a community DAO, our own $token and tokenomics that holders can earn daily and also be paid out by doing different tasks. I would love for it to have community created/voted on utility, i.e how to gamify the token, access to areas and content in the metaverse etc.   The ideas seem great in my head, but I need to find some experienced team members to help make it a reality. I think the art is already there and I love the designer, but I think value is way more important than the art. I’m looking for a couple devs and some dcord community managers. And of course marketing.  Thanks for your time for reading this and I would greatly appreciate any ideas/help especially in regards to innovative utility ideas and ways to provide value to holders.",0.9951,0.0,0.738,0.262
"As someone who is a big fan and admirer of music created by the Beatles and John Lennon, this news made me very happy because we, who are big music fans and who also trade in NFTs, have the opportunity to combine nice and useful and participate in such NFT auctions made for real collectors.       What I was able to find out through the articles is that John Lennon’s eldest son Julian is selling some of the rarest pieces of music history from his private collection such as John Lennon's coat from the Magical Mystery Tour film, his cape from Help, three guitars and Paul McCartney's handwritten arrangement notes for Hey Jude. This could be one of the most precious NFT auctions I've known for.       Julian would keep the original physical items and the buyer would own the rights to the unique NFT.     The most notable item that is expected to attract the highest bid is said to be the hand-written note by Paul McCartney for Hey Jude. The NFT for the item has a starting price of $30,000!       Because of the news like this, I was inspired to inquire about some good music NFT platforms and marketplaces and as a recommendation, I got before a few days was an amazing music NFT universe called Centaurify.     Have you had any experience with it?       I will definitely follow this news, I hope that in time there will be more and more auctions like this dedicated to great people from the world of music.",0.9952,0.0,0.789,0.211
" Hello my friends. My name is Danil. I am from Kazakhstan, from the birthplace of Borat. We're fine, come visit us :)  My english is very bad so sorry for the spelling mistakes.  I  want to share a little story. About myself. I wanted to start my own  business, but the attempts were not successful, I got into debt for  20,000 dollars. I have already returned $ 10,000, but since there is  very little time left, I do not have time to return the rest on time.  That is why I created my NFT collection.  My  collection was created without a budget. I don’t have money for  advertising, I couldn’t even find money to pay for gas on the Ethereum  network. That's why I posted it on the Polygon network.  I  need your help, I ask you to subscribe to my account on instagram,  twitter. To let as many people as possible know about my history and my  collection. Share this story with your friends. Maybe someone can help  me in this situation.  Having sold  100 NFTs, I will receive the required amount ($10,000). Each NFT costs  0.03 Ethereum. This is the amount that is needed to pay my debt. I will  be very grateful to you. After all, this community is capable of many  things.  My collection was not  created to ridicule or offend anyone. We all need to smile more often  and be able to laugh, especially at ourselves.  I  would be extremely grateful if you support me and tell all your friends  and acquaintances about it. This is how you save a person.  Good luck and thank you for taking the time to read my story.

"I can't help but notice how many people are so salty, and envious over other people's success in crypto. This is especially the case for lower cap and smaller cryptocurrencies. If someone makes money there most will pass of judgement as 'lucky' or 'he'll blow it as fast as he made it'.  The case is further exacerbate once NFTs are brought into the mix. The sh&amp;t hits the fan on Reddit and similar blogs and most commenters will be enraged and spewing pure hatred at some innocent guy who wanted to talk about his profits. So why is that? Why do some people make money, and why do other make bags?  1. **Bad Investing Advice.**  Most investors want to make **money**, and that's perfectly fine. Problem is there are two very vast different approaches to it.    1. Either people take it too seriously    2. Or people don't take it seriously enough  *Bear with me here*  &gt;Some investors, as is most often the case with the veteran investors who have been in this game pre 2019 (an ancient time before the world knew Covid), will take crypto investing way too seriously. They'll only drop a 2% of their portfolio on a token they have full confidence in. This includes full roadmap, high market cap (top 50), and they have to know the creators on a personal first name basis.   &gt;   &gt;Although this is fine in its own right, you can't expect massive riches when you play it safe like this. With risk comes reward, and if you choose safety you get what you pay for.   &gt;   &gt;You harvest what you reap   &gt;   &gt;New investors, on the other hand, will only go gem-hunting, searching for the most recent tiktok or the most viral tweet and throw their money recklessly wherever that leads them. Well if you throw a pile of rocks at a lake you're bound to hit it, but at the point the loss-win ratio has been abused to the pulp.   &gt;   &gt;Both approaches are too extreme. One must sit back and consider the risk-to-reward and find what fits them.  2. **Bad sources.** The other crucial element to investing. Most people will look to tiktok, youtube, twitter for the next crypto asset to invest in. Although there's nothing wrong with that on its own, those sources are often biased and will only point you to the highest bidder.  The truth is any source can be appropriate, it's not the sources' fault, but the most important thing to do is to **asses the asset,** and **speculate** (properly) **whether or not it has a potential shot at success.**  For example just the other day one of my friends suggested the latest NFT project, the Royal Falcons Club, which has an interesting concept. Each NFT edition is not only collectible and part of a mega-collection, but each edition has unique and desirable rarities that provide the owner (at the time) certain rewards (one of those is a Tesla I believe lol). That is an interesting concept and a grand idea, we made our models and studied their roadmap, and after deliberation we decided to pool our money and buy into the **idea**.  Which leads me into the next issue, people; more often than not, buy into hype rather than ideas. If the hype has reached you...I'm sorry you have to hear this from me, it has already peaked. My point is, if you want success, PLAN AHEAD. Do your research properly, study projects and ideas not hype and desire. Don't be afraid of investing in something (I used to fear NFTs before this LOL), intuition is dumb, logic and math doesn't lie...  *The present was built on innovation and ideas, and so will the future.*",0.9952,0.079,0.77,0.151

"1. Digital Asset. A Music NFT is a first of a kind asset for music that allows collectors to stake value in an artist’s success or IP. The NFT’s success will depend on the artist’s ability to drive value, regardless of any “royalty split”.  2. New NFT Category. If you’re reading this, you’re super early to Music NFTs. Collectors are still focused on jpegs and pfps, which have much higher volume that the music category. Getting in early on an emerging market is the way to make big gains. Volume is coming.  3. Content / Marketing. With Music NFTs, you get everything a jpeg has and more. The music itself is utility, and provides the long term marketing plan as the artist’s career grows. Music NFTs have so much content behind them. The NFT is a connection to the success of the content  4. Onboarding Masses. In my opinion Music NFTs will be one of the best categories for onboarding the mainstream. Music is consumed by so many people who might not be as interested in other types of art NFTs. Furthermore, features like live events &amp; merch are more easily explained  5. The Artists. We all know that the music industry has a reputation for predatory deals with artists. Music NFTs offer a way for the artists to get the funding they deserve - and the successful innovators will deliver massive value to collectors, rather than the record label.  Thanks for reading!

" More about passive income 👉 [https://twitter.com/A\_G\_Eth](https://twitter.com/A_G_Eth)    **It’s shockingly ironic that Non-fungible Token is becoming “Fungible”.**  When you search for new NFT projects on Opensea, there are numerous of them springing up. But you can easily see the similarity: first of all is the introduction. *All NFTs are dope/cool/good, but some are rarer/cooler than others*; then is the exclusive community member benefits, and finally nearly all the roadmap leads to games or metaverse.  However dope the art is, the **similarity of utilities** always leads to aesthetic fatigue.  There are merits, though. Some of them have vibrant ...cord communities. I myself joined several nice ones, and I find most of them helpful. I am proud to be one of the early players in the NFT world since 2019.    **But, is game(e.g. P2E, Sandbox) the only way for us community members to migrate to metaverse?**    As a NFT practitioner and collector since 2019, I have participated in creating a P2E game *Alpaca City*, a credential service *Project Galaxy*; I also joined BAYC(my first NFT community) in July 2021. I witnessed the heydays that we tried different things about NFT: puzzles, cartoons, generative art, DAO, etc. We also attempted to increase the liquidity of NFT assets, which is quite different from now where the metaverse games rule the roost.    Metaverse games are cool. But the reason why blockchain attracts me is its decentralized feature and the infinite possibilities the smart contracts can make. We love the innovative ideas: CryptoPunks for it marked the new era of digital art, and Bored Ape for it pioneered in building a NFT community belonging to its holders on blockchain.    But now the NFT market is full of capital bubbles because of imitations and price manipulations. Also, there are too many projects intending to make a quick buck and abandon their communities and holders. (I once got tricked by clicking a DM, and bought a NFTs from irresponsible teams).    We witnessed the thriving of those innovative projects and the takeoff of their trading volume, so now we are immersing ourselves in minting different but intrinsically similar NFTs, being busy imitating. But what has been ignored is that **Ethereum is still in its infancy stage and what we should do is helping it to embrace diversity** In my views, most new NFT projects have no actual utilities except for meme images. This leads to the value of those NFTs mainly depending on how a community develops or price manipulation.    As a NFTs buyer, I think there are 2 kinds of NFTs: **purely art NFTs and utility NFTs.** The former is for our emotional fulfillment, but paying for the latter is largely due to community benefits, a social identity, or playing games. Besides, the most important reason may be that we want to get arbitrage, especially when there is increasing number of NFT buyers.

"Hi guys!    I know that my question might sound a bit stupid. I would say even weird. But, I've recently discovered NFTs and would like to find out whether it is possible to profit from them. I accidentally ran into some info about how to start trading NFTs,  and so far, I can say that this type of asset I find promising. Still, it would be pretty interesting for me to find out whether one of you has succeeded in profiting from this type of asset.    So, I've started digging some info about NFT's to find out more about them. To be honest, I'm still don't know too much about them. I'm primarily interested in trading Bitcoins and some popular altcoins. Still, it's a bit exciting to find out about some possible alternatives. Besides, I found out that NFT is considered one of the main trends of 2021 in the blockchain. There is more and more news from the NFT world. But there are few places where they really explain what NFT is.    So, apart from NFT = Non-Fungible Token, I also found out that NFT is a technology that will significantly impact all areas of our lives. Because it allows you to digitize the interaction with any virtual and physical goods. I know that it doesn't sound too promising from my own words. Besides, I haven't even profited from it yet. Again, that's why I'm writing in this sub.    In my opinion, according to everything I have found so far, I can say that since tokens are stored in an open and distributed blockchain, information about this product, its owner, and the history of transactions with this product will always be available and reliable. We can always know who made which product and who it belongs to at the moment. But the question is if it adds any value to NFTs as an asset?    I'm sorry for keeping it too long. I just wanted to discuss the possibility of making some profit on NFTs like traders usually make on other cryptocurrencies. Please, correct me if I'm wrong about anything since I'm a rookie, particularly in this niche.",0.9955,0.037,0.792,0.171
"COVID reminded the world why community and connection is vital to our survival, let alone happiness and that extends to our relationship with pets.   We’ve been developing a connected pet platform with aspirations to disrupt what is a very siloed, transactional and disconnected pet care industry.  We’re so excited by the potential of the platform and the community it can facilitate. This community is one of the most engaged, passionate and loving.  So why the NFT shout out?   So many NFT projects focus on animals and some do a good of supporting the community with % charitable donations etc with the rest going towards a hasty roadmap of added community features (let me know if you think I'm wrong) but this should be at a minimum.  A core component of our business is to build tools that facilitate self-service and interoperability for charities, shelters and veterinary services which can’t be achieved by themselves as so many are just about surviving and a majority of time and resource is spent on manual tasks (especially here in Asia).  In essence we believe the development of NFTs serve a larger purpose for our business - it allows us to: - raise capital for an established and quantified roadmap with drivers for scale and change across the pet ecosystem - continuous donations via royal Otis’s - establish hyper engaged members for participatory design and feature development  - maintain a broader global reach   So why post this?   Recently a friend introduced me to the term ‘Generational Social Media Mental Block’ or GSMMB. I was amazed this was even a thing.   I’ve struggled with social and put it down to introversion and growing up to stay quiet about your endeavours and let them speak for themselves…but that isn’t how the world works anymore and you can’t wait for anything to be/appear perfect.  I’d love to hear from anyone who’s building something they care about, trying to dive in to NFTs, loves animals and or is working through their own version of GSMMB.  👋🏼",0.9955,0.013,0.808,0.179
"These digital certificates of authenticity, which share the same technology as cryptocurrencies, have triggered the art market and new business models  Three letters, an acronym, have become one of the terms that has burst in with more force in this 2021 that is about to end. It is NFT , *Non Fungible Token* or Non-Fungible Tokens, which is a digital certificate of authenticity that is associated with a single digital file through blockchain technology , the same one used in cryptocurrencies . From there, a new form of digital expression has been built that has triggered the art market in 2021 .  On paper, the operation of the [NFT development ](https://www.blockchainx.tech/non-fungible-token-development)is simple. A given image, video, audio, text, or compressed file gets an identifier that records the author's name, start value, and sales history, among other metadata. This non-fungible good - it cannot be duplicated, nor is it consumed with its use, nor can it be replaced by something else - has unleashed a true fever in the form of crypto art this year .  Yes, the sale of NFTs is a new way of (trying to) earn money easily in the *online* world , but the truth is that there are many artists, influencers, celebrities, companies and organizations that are riding a wave that, in 2021, it has generated more than 3,000 million euros .  According to a recent analysis by ArTactic, “the art world is undergoing a generational shift towards young collectors”, especially driven by new millionaires whose fortunes come from technology companies in Asian countries . It remains to be resolved whether NFTs have become the new bubble or, on the other hand, whether they have established themselves as one of the main agents in the art world.  An exact date can be fixed when NFTs entered a new era. It was last March 11, when the JPG file 'Everydays - The First 5,000 Days' ('Every Day: The first 5,000 Days'), created by the artist Beeple ( Mike Winkelmann) was sold for 69.3 million dollars (57.8 million euros) by Christie's auction house in New York.  ## FROM A 'TWEET' TO A VAN GOGH  From then on, news about pieces of crypto art multiplied throughout the world. Without leaving the month of March, a columnist for The New York Times soldone item for $560,000 ; an internet user bought a digital sticker of Cristiano Ronaldo for 240,000 euros ; Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey sold his first tweet for $2.9 million and someone bought a digital portrait made by the robot Shopia for $650,000 at auction.  Already in April 2021, the protagonist of the famous *Disaster Girl* meme pocketed $500,000 from the sale of the original file. In May, Larva Labs sold nine Cryptopunk heads , digital creatures designed in 2017 by the pioneering startup NFT , for $16.9 million . In July, Berners-Lee made $4.5 million from the sale of the original WWW archive , which he developed in 1991. And already in September, Russia's leading museum, the Hermitage in St. Petersburg , raised nearly half a million dollars by auction NFT of works from his collection, specifically a Van Gogh, a Kandinsky, a Da Vinci, a Monet and a Giorgione .  Thus, in just a few months the market for digital collections has established itself with a considerable volume of business. There are opportunities for all tastes and pockets. *YouTuber* Willyrex , for example, will be selling his own NFT collectibles for prices as high as €2,000 per digital item .  ## FROM LALIGA STICKERS TO A YACHT  For its part, the NBA has raffled off great plays in the history of North American basketball in virtual card packs priced between $9 and $299, creating a new business model. Without going any further, LaLiga has recently reached an agreement with Sorare , a company owned by footballers such as Gerard Piqué, Antoine Griezmann or Rio Ferdinand , to distribute player NFTs and thus open a new source of income for clubs. And brands like Marvel are also developing their own certified files.  Precisely, Nicolás Julia, co-founder of Sorare , defends that the [development of NFT ](https://www.blockchainx.tech/non-fungible-token-development)business is not a bubble: ""There has been an upturn in interest and, although there may be a temporary overexcitement, the NFT trend is not. Like most innovations, there may be a little foam and euphoria in the market , but that's about it"".  Special mention deserves the metaverse , the new parallel dimension in which tokens can end up imposing themselves as a business with incalculable potential. Not surprisingly, a few weeks ago, $650,000 was paid for the *Mataflower* , a digital yacht made of bits and bytes , in the Sandbox multiverse. Meanwhile, in real life, galleries and auction houses continue to delve into the world of NFTs: Julien's Auctions in Beverly Hills is putting up a Ketih Richards Gibson ES-335 guitar in an upcoming auction, accompanied by a clip of the rolling stone stamps his signature on the instrument. Today it is impossible to glimpse the limit of non-fungible tokens.",0.9958,0.008,0.909,0.083
"  *Processing img 91hr9yig9lh81...*     **Pigletz is a collectible game with DeFi elements. It is built around the main character - the Piglet, an NFT having a utility as a piggy bank where users can deposit crypto tokens and earn PiFi. Pigletz are items. A contemporary version of a piggy bank. An item that can exist in the MetaVerse. And also can exist in the real world. But not in both. Each Piglet starts its life randomly minted and at level 1. Being at level 1 means that only some of its treats are revealed. In order to progress with levels and reveal more traits the owner of the Piglet needs to wait and collect PiFi (similar as eXperience Points). There are options to speed up the collection - for example by completing tasks and activating boosters. Each Piglet has its own wallet - a smart contract that is owned by the Piglet itself. Breaking is the final step in the life of a Piglet. By breaking it the owner is actually killing it, losing its NFT/collectable value, but gaining all the assets within it. One of its unique features is the option to materialize the Piglet. In order to do that the owner stakes the piglet in a specific contract and obtains a real 3D printed Pigletz figure. While being materialized the NFT is locked and cannot be transferred. The only way to unlock it is to break the Pigletz figure (in the real world) and to use the codes inside of it to unlock it. At the end the game is all about the dilemma - which is more valuable - the Piglet as an NFT or the tokens inside of it.**  ❎ **You can find daily updates on this project at** [**r/pigletz**](https://www.reddit.com/r/pigletz/)  What makes this project so unique is that the team is fully transparent and have members that are experienced in different skills. They have managed to deliver everything that they have promised on their roadmap and have many surprises planned for the future. There is no useless hype around the project, they are just working hard to make it better. Until now, Pigletz.com haven't invested in marketing, but this is about to change very soon. They have planned several deals with Influencers and sponsorships with other companies are being negotiated.  Translated in ape language : Very bullish. Soon moon 🚀  ❎ **What have they done so far :**  They are already crushing the concurrence with two main achievements.  ✅ **1 - Pigletz.com NFT Piggy Bank is now Live on Binance NFT Marketplace.**  Pigletz.com, the collectible NFT piggy bank, is now live on Binance NFT Marketplace. The announcement comes a week after BeFaster.fit, a Maltese blockchain-powered fitness app, deposited millions worth of the founders' tokens into a Piglet, demonstrating one of the new utilities, coming to NFTs in 2022.  Pigletz.com has been listed on one of the world's largest centralized NFT marketplaces after the project's Smart Contract has successfully passed the required review process.  NFT enthusiasts can purchase Pigletz Mystery Boxes from Binance NFT at press time. To celebrate the big news, Pigletz.com is offering the items at special prices this weekend.

From January 17, 2022 until the release of the app, all of the founders' tokens will be locked inside a single Piglet. This inventive move aims to further cement the BeFaster.fit statement of security against token price manipulation and simultaneously demonstrates the new fields of application of non-fungible tokens, emerging in 2022.  In the latest important development the startup has decided to use the innovative utility of the recently-launched Pigletz NFT project and deposit all their founders' BFHT tokens into an individual Piglet. This would render them unusable until the virtual piggy bank is broken - an inbuilt functionality of the collectible. This act releases all tokens held inside but also destroys the NFT, ensuring the deflationary nature of the remaining Pigletz.  Their motto is first develop and then talk about it, which is amazing, but I cannot keep in secret what's coming next. They are working on a mobile game similar to Pokemon Go with integrated NFT's. Bridges to other ecosystems and not only Binance Smart Chain. Huge marketing deals. Integration with fitness App and possible Bets through their tokens.

"Hi everyone! Wanted to get your feedback.   The True Tush Collection is my fine art lingerie/boudoir photo collection and each image celebrates real everyday women, wives, and mothers.  JSeboudoir studios was created when a wife and mother did not believe she was beautiful in the way her husband said she was, so her husband sought to show her, through his eye of photography, that she indeed was.  Through their images, she rediscovered herself, felt empowered, and she increased her self-acceptance ands self-love.  Their images gave her a glimpse of how he saw her.    JSeboudoir then began serving its local community as a boudoir photographer and now look to share the greater NFT community with our fine art images.  Their images are captured with the effective use of lighting and posing beautiful, gorgeous, everyday working professional woman celebrating their sensuality.   True Tush showcases each model's ""tush"" in its truest form. Real, unedited, AND still sexy. It defeats the whole purpose of our work if we edited the bodies of women, wives, and mothers who we believe are beautiful just as they are.

I won a super cute NFT and my plan was to transfer it into her account.  I didn’t feel right publishing her wallet address yet, and would prefer to let her make that decision when she is ready.  I did not know there would be a fee to do so.  Is there a way to send it to her wallet without the fee?  I do not have any ETH in my account so I’m not exactly sure how to proceed.

"I have been observing the development path of blockchain for a long time and it has always fascinated me, I was looking for a platform that would provide me with the best possible blockchain and to be honest I was not very happy with what I found     Until a colleague at work who is a big fan of pc games told me about a platform he found accidentally, he read an online article about it and wanted to try it himself. The platform is called ICICB and provides supposedly the fastest blockchain in the world.      But what he, and I, who am also a big fan of games, liked was that they developed blockchain solutions for the gaming industry, they invented one of the fastest blockchains in the world for sure.

" I've had many requests to cover Tezos and their thriving involvement in the NFT space.  In short, it's a great platform and I actually love the community and blockchain. The long answer is below....  It's definitely no secret that the Tezos blockchain has become a hotbed for NFT engagement. In the past 12 months, the blockchain has seen over 50,000 transactions a day, increased from 10,000 in January 2021 and NFT platforms have been a huge driver of that growth.  But out of all the blockchains and NFT platforms out there, why mint and sell your artwork on Tezos? I believe it is due to three main reasons. Eco-friendliness, low transaction costs, and a very strong NFT community.  \----------------------------------------------  **Eco-Friendly**  Compared to proof of work blockchains, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Tezos validates transactions more efficiently through their Liquid Proof of Stake (PoS) protocol. Although PoS blockchains still utilize cryptography, their energy consumption is dramatically lower because miners do not need to solve extremely complex puzzles to prove their work on PoS blockchains.  So why would you mint your NFTs on Tezos? In short, Tezos is ecologically friendly and just as secure.  **Low Transaction Fees**  This should be fairly obvious. Tezos transactions cost about 0.0004 XTZ, which equates to around $0.0023. This allows NFTs of any value, big or small to be transacted, both easily and cheaply. If you're starting out in the space as an artist or creator and only selling your items for a small amount, this reduces the friction for a buyer to purchase your work.  A high transaction fee in addition to the various platform fees can eat through your earnings and make it economically unfeasible. This is why so many artists cut their NFT career short using Ethereum.  **Strong NFT Community**  The entire community on Tezos, and more specifically for NFTs are lively and inclusive. I can almost guarantee if you posted a question on their Twitter, you would receive an answer within the hour from someone in their community. The community has a strong love for art, tech, and the ecosystem as a whole. This is what makes or breaks a community-based space. Lack of community.  It’s quite an exciting time to be in the Tezos ecosystem and there is much, much more to come from it. This is only just the beginning. Don't be afraid to utilize other great blockchains for your projects, they will continue to prosper through the growth of this space. #WAGMI",0.9962,0.033,0.801,0.166
"Hello everyone, I would like to ask you a few questions about creating nft collection. I did some research, but I am still not sure about a few things. I have an idea for project of digital abstract art, but I can not say exactly what, because I didn't see anything similar yet. That can be an advantage or also disadvantage. Let's see.😂 But I am still wondering how to do it so it would have chance to start off well but also keep the value for the buyers through the years.   1. Is it better to mint all the collection at the same time or adding pieces one by one as I am making them? I like steady growth by adding one by one, but I am also kind of worried about someone just copping the idea when I will still be at the start of the project. 😅   2. How straight should I be with the story behind the art?  Each piece and all collection together have hidden meaning, I am wondering - should I say it from the begging and increase the chance for successful first sales or leave the info for later as surprise that could help owners with secondary sell?   3. Is it better to do collection of for example 300 pieces or make 8 copies of the piece with different colors (2400 pieces together). Making original could take a few hours. Making a copy a few minutes.  With copies I could sell much cheaper considering normal hourly pay.  But I am also wondering would it be safer investment for the buyer if it would be just the original?   4. Of course my goal is to make money, but I want the nfts to be also good investment for the buyer. Do you have some other advice regarding this?   Thank you very much.  Keep safe :)",0.9962,0.036,0.745,0.219
"Ok folks! We're here and we're ready to steer ... our ship to greatness ... lol  Just wanted to share some updates with the community.  Shoutout to our art team for putting together our first draft NFT. Say hello to the first yachtie!    [Would you be my friend? I would be my friend](https://preview.redd.it/cypkc9brpv981.jpg?width=2500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f04599298ed6c2cb7ca7f6fcf7d6ef75863391fd)  For those that are new : We're minting 8,888 NFT's, buying a yacht and sailing it around the world.  The last time I posted we got a lot of love and a lot of ""feedback"". Thanks to everyone who has shown support to the project.  To answer some of the questions that were raised last time :  **How will you cover the expenses?** Yachts cost a lot to operate and maintain  Say we raise $20 million. 60% of that will be used to purchase the yacht and 40% will be added to our treasury. Yacht's cost \~20% of their purchase price to operate / maintain \[[source](https://www.worldwideluxuryyacht.com/blog/real-cost-to-own-a-yacht/)\]. That means we need 12% of TF (total funds) to cover our expenses. With our treasury in a Defi Fund we need to earn 30% APR, bare minimum, to cover our expenses (12% = 40%\*.3). We can **easily** do this with Defi and NFT projects.    **What if you make mistakes?** What if it's not enough?  Yachts are ""known value assets"" meaning their price is well known and doesn't really fluctuate. We can either :   1: use financing to purchase our yacht and increase the amount of funds in our treasury to 70-80% of **TF**  2: buy our yacht outright and then take a loan against it, again increasing the funds in our treasury  **If you have 8,888 NFT's, how will everyone get on the boat?**  So unfortunately not everyone can go to every party ... (unless we buy a cruise ship ... :P) So what we are going to do is have a rolling ticket system. Each party will have a mint of tickets. We estimate we can have anywhere from 200-400 people on board each party (depends how big of a ship we buy). Once you have minted a ticket for a party you will have a time delay added to your NFT (they will rust on an annual basis). For the next mint you will have to wait 5 minutes before attempting to mint your ticket. That way if you don't get a ticket to the first party, you are more likely to get access to the next, and so on.  **How will you pay for the parties?**   The party costs will also come from the revenue of our treasury fund. We are intentionally being really conservative with our estimates so that we are making way more than we spend. We intend to increase the value of our fund over time, allowing ""yachties"" access to more, unique experiences.  **How are you going to market this project?**  We're starting with old fashioned shilling. We've got a team of 5 experienced shillers who are out there, in a d.iscord group near you, promoting the project. In addition we are focused on creating content here on Reddit, as well as Twitter and Medium. It's not much but we've grown our d.iscord to 250 members so far and are going to keep scaling this way for the next two weeks. **Ultimately,**  we are going to raise funds for promoting this project -- in order to do a $20mil mint we need a LOT of people aware of our projects. To do this we are selling 10 NFT's to early investors, starting at 10 ETH. These will let the holder charter the yacht for a week each year as well as airdropping them 5 yachties at mint. We are going to use these funds to promote our project via influencers and collabs with other established projects.    Want to join the party?? \[Link in Comments ⬇⬇\]    We are really excited about this project. It's a lofty goal and we think we have built the right team to pull it off.

Finally, the wait is over, at the end of last week, the Metaplace administration made the big reveal. The staking feature that all community members were looking forward to is finally here.  Like all other projects available on DeFi space, Metaplace, too, is motivated to provide best income generating solutions for its community members. Since staking was a much demanded feature as a result of the poll conducted on the platform, the administration took it upon itself to provide it.  Metaplace has partnered with Chainlist.finance to enable staking on its platform. Chainlist.finance is a NFTs marketplace with staking utility on Binance smart chain, that connects social media networking sites with DeFi. This marketplace enables converting original digital content into NFTs using BEP-20 token standards. This partnered project will be our first official partner on BSC.  Metaplace has the aim to consistently upgrade itself with desirable features. First, it introduced as a decentralized online marketplace on Binance smart chain blockchain. In a decentralized online marketplace, technology replaces the traditional drivers of the market. The structures responsible for matching buyers and sellers, seamless transactions, and an institutional infrastructure is replaced by blockchain technology. Metaplace uses this technology to build an all in one decentralized token driven e-marketplace with additional features.  While Metaplce believes in constant upgradation of its features, its partnership with Chainlist.finance has enabled it to acquire the most requested feature on its platform for passive income generation. Let’s look into what Staking is really.  Two years ago, a new consensus mechanism called Proof of Stake was introduced. This gave rise to the idea of ​​increasing speed and efficiency while lowering prices. One of the most important ways to reduce costs is that not all of these miners tackle math problems, which are energy-intensive processes. Instead, the transaction is literally validated by people betting on the blockchain. In a process called staking.  Staking is a process similar to mining, essentially allowing network participants to add new batches of transactions to the blockchain. Aside from some basic changes that vary from project to project, the core procedure for most crypto projects is to place tokens to allow you to add new blocks to your blockchain in exchange for rewards. Metaplace provides users with multiple pools of liquidity for betting tokens. Each pool has a different duration and generous APY specificity.  These staking pools will offer at max an APY of 500%. Users will also don’t need to pay any tax fee on their staked MPC tokens. Besides, no time frame will be set for the minimum withdrawal limit, users will be able to withdraw whenever they like. Staking pools at Metaplace will be live right after the launch of the project in the first quarter.  # Staking Pools overview  **Stake $MPC-$MPC Pool**       *Processing img b2gdjz16bd681...*  In this staking pool, audiences can convert their digital currency first into BNB and then use BNB to buy Metaplace native tokens.

"Alright, let me start off by saying that I am a complete newbie to the NFT game. I've been trying to grasp the concept of NFTs and how they are created, sold, and how they are valued, but I just can't seem to. Every article I read will contradict the last or will praise this creator over others and I've found it unbelievable hard to find some real, helpful information.  That being said, here's a small list of questions I'd specifically like to hear thoughts about from you guys.  ● First, I'd like to know where and how a newcomer should buy NFTs. What's the best Crypto/NFT Wallet and the best Crypto to use as payment in your opinion?  ● What are the better dApps to use and why?  ● How does someone choose which NFTs to buy or atleast pay attention to? What determines the value of an NFT and how do they gain or lose value?  ● What's the best method for creating an NFT and how can any typical Bob sell them?  ● Do you guys honestly see the NFT market as a viable way to make money in the future and why?  ● Are NFTs secure? Can they be stolen from a crypto wallet? Can they be copyrighted? Are NFTs taxable and are there any laws surrounding the NFT market?  I really do appreciate any tips and advice on how a newcomer can get into the NFT trade. I do apologize if some of these questions seem stupid or aren't properly worded, I just really want to learn as much as possible from people who actually work in NFTs as opposed to articles or advertisements made by people with interest in certain ones. Thanks for your time.",0.9966,0.054,0.705,0.241

The community is still small and growing which puts you in with an even better chance to win these insane rewards. The NFT’s are still available to mint for only 0.15 Eth too! If this sounds like something you will even be the slightest bit interested in then it was worth atleast a minute to check on the Instagram page and join the community who can help answer any questions. I’m not a creator of the NFT just a football fan who thinks every other football fan should have the opportunity to have this sort of access to players and the chance to win amazing football based experiences.

"  I don’t think this point is very clear, because I rarely see people talk about this, or even understand this. Cryptocurrency is not to America what it is to the rest of the world, and here’s why.    The background Americans have before they get into crypto is different and unique. Being an American, you grow up hearing names like Facebook, Zuccerberg and buffet. Which is why these people affect communal thought so much.   Another thing Americans grow up knowing is the value of art among the elite. You see, it’s a common TV trope and part of popular culture to know that modern art that doesn’t look like much but is heavily desirable or shilled by someone famous is extremely, extremely expensive. Which I personally believe directly lead to the massive rush into the NFT spectrum. Maybe subconsciously, or consciously too, they believed this would be the next modern art movement, and that they would be there this time not as witnesses, but as actors. As flippers and schillers and resellers. Well, it worked. Guess they were right then eh?  Well, there’s more to that than this. What you need to know is that yes this is part of the definite answer, NFT are desirable because they are, well, desirable. Not much too it more than that… But NFTs are not what they used to be what they were before, they are for sure evolving. Just the other day, a friend mentioned the Royal Falcons Club and their unique reward system strategy. Glad it’s finally showing its true feathers.   My point is, the background you have affects your investment portfolio. Americans would be directed to what relates best to popular culture, meanwhile the rest of the world would go for what they believe would make profit, or what they believe, yes, Americans would buy…",0.9966,0.0,0.801,0.199
"Hi guys, I'm a graphic designer and illustrator. I've been creating some cute fun characters on the side as a hobby since 2018. Recently after a discussion with a friend on a podcast he convinced me to look into NFTs as a perfect fit for my case ( creating collections ). I heard about NFTs before but didn't really pay attention to them.  Of course now I have this weird feeling of FOMO as well as being overwhelmed by all the info out there. If I'm honest the monetary part of it is not a big deal for me ( I'm ok with design work and Tech Youtube ), I truly enjoy making cute stuff and it's my meditative way. I know there are a lot of creators out there now but I don't really see it as a competition, more like a way to express myself and Art.  I'm asking if you have any suggestions about how to approach the NFT space as an illustrator. I've learned about the Metaverse and its potential and it got me really excited as a creator.  So I want to put my characters and the universe around them as NFTs and potentially sell them.  I've been given advice by a friend involved in NFTs to learn to code or find a developer to create smart contracts, that in itself put off at first since I'm not a developer and don't want to overcomplicate things in my baby steps.  So the questions I have are : Should I create a community around my characters and the Universe, then build from there ? Or just put my collections on websites like Rarible ? Any other suggestions or Platforms you know about that would suitable for my case ?  Thanks for the feedback 😊",0.9968,0.007,0.749,0.243
"After three weeks, 15 minted pieces, and a ton of hard work, I'm glad to say today we sold our first Legendary Rap Bagel - The Roc Marciano Bagel. As we've built this project out, we've learned a lot along the way and I wanted to share some reflections with you all.  First, it's disheartening to see fears of rug pulls and high gas fees, but it's the reality of where we're at today amidst the NFT hype.  As we build this thing organically, our social media presence has slowly grown and Cousin Stizz has even noticed our project which is great. However, it's hard to stand out as an ""honest project.""  Nevertheless, we're excited to continue building this small and exclusive collection in hopes of achieving our main goal - developing and publishing, whether digitally or physically, a hip-hop based/bagel sandwich art/cookbook.  **Lessons Learned**  1. **Build Up Hype First:** Attempt to build up your social media presence prior to initiating your project, especially before your first mint. It's painful to see your pieces online without being sold, but you have to keep on pushing. 2. **Find A Good Partner:** My partner, an old high school friend, is an incredible digital artist with a passion for this kind of work so it helps to lean on her when I'm feeling down.  3. **Believe In The Project:** I truly believe this project is unique and has merit. No, it's no BAYC and never will be, but if anything it's a fun opportunity for people to jump into crypto at a low floor price of 0.03 ETH - already helped some friends get wallets, etc. - while having some cool art. That's important on down days. I love the art so I stay motivated.  I hope this offers some insight into the highs and lows of NFT production! Either way, 1 NFT sold which is all the validation I could ask for!  Thanks,",0.9969,0.056,0.721,0.223

I'm a person who loves to create art with a strong background in Game Design and Digital Art. I thought I would throw my hat in the NFT ring and bring to life a fun idea I had for a collection. As an Anime and Shiba Inu crypto currency fan. I figured I would combine the two to create some cute colorful avatars called Shibotakus.  I'm a firm Shiba Inu Coin believer, it is the coin of the people, with a bright future, and I want to do my part to help the shibarmy reach the 1 cent dream. 50% profit from the initial sale of all items in this collection will go towards the burning of the Shiba Inu crypto currency. 2% of the royalties from this collection will forever go towards charities to feed hungry children.  I am very grateful for all the support I have gotten so far and will be doing the first burn on August 1st to also celebrate the birth of the Shiba Inu Coin. I'd love any advice on the cheapest method to convert WETH to SHIB in order to burn it.  Thank you for everyone who bought the NFTs and supported this project. I am very humbled that so many people like my collection.  Special thanks to Kay-Leaf for being the first person to buy a Shibotaku NFT. And another special thanks to Morir\_Invictus who bought the whole current collection.    https://preview.redd.it/v22ydke73mp81.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6043fffdb1513db6f847e5d679af32bc7c7d827d  https://preview.redd.it/qf9weke73mp81.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8334b752b12ad48d94be5498cb78a1a6ebe0aca7",0.997,0.0,0.736,0.264
" The worlds of online gaming and NFTs have merged to the point where they are currently strongly intertwined within the gaming industry. People are not just enjoying the all-new gaming universes thoroughly, but also concurrently participating in its growth and development ahead.    These NFT games are becoming increasingly popular, due to their ability to provide monetary benefits. As the gaming industry become increasingly commoditized, cryptocurrency may have a role to play.   *Processing video 5shiqgxory781...*  &gt; Here, we will talk about one top choice over the upcoming NFT games that would obviously take your attention. This NFT game is called ***The Planet of Animals***.  [**The Planet of Animals**](https://twitter.com/AnimalPlanetGFi), an NFT game, is one of those promising NFT Games in the market. This project uses blockchain technology in order to:  1. Prove the history of ownership. 2. Assets secured with blockchain are immutable, they cannot be changed or edited. 3. Decentralization: it is available to all players to view and use.  It is expected that one of the prominent entries among the most popular NFT games in 2022 would refer to the Planet of Animals. The game has some thematic similarities to the jungle game franchise, with the power of blockchain making it more engaging. The primary objective of players in this game is the breeding and collection of NFT-based characters known as predators and non-predators animals.   Based on the Binance blockchain, the planet of animals game characters players against one another. Players should note that the planet of animals is a unique addition among the best NFT games, with the facility of a unique skill for each animal. Therefore, players could also discover the transfer of strengths and weaknesses from animals to their cubs.   Players receive rewards for each mission, adventure mode, player-versus-player fight and etc. In addition, PECs could help players in breeding new animals, and players could also purchase PECs through exchanges. Another important highlight of the planet of animals refers to the PTAT. It is basically an ERC-20 token available as a native token on the planet of animals as the governance token of the platform.   It is also important to note the rarity tiers for tradable collectibles on the planet of animals. As a matter of fact, it is expected to become one of the unique entries in the NFT games list with distinct categories for collectibles according to their rarity. Its rarity tiers include challenge, followed by epic, and then legendary, with victory being the ultimate goal.   In general, players could use the native utility token $PTAT for purchasing the collectibles and also for using them in tournaments. Furthermore, players could also sell the PEC tokens on secondary NFT marketplaces for potential returns.    **Final Words**  The different entries among top NFT games have distinct ways of providing engaging experiences to gamers. From the first look, NFT games might not be the alternatives you are looking for right now. However, the planet of animals has changed the way you perceive the world of gaming as it enables players to earn returns on their efforts.   It enables players to participate in the game and generate, breed, or collect unique in-game assets. Subsequently, players can get favorable returns for the unique assets or collectibles based on their rarity. Therefore, the planet of animals can transform the traditional ways in which you perceive gaming with their exceptional value.    ***Join The Planet of Animals communities:***  **Website**: [https://www.planetofanimals.io](https://www.planetofanimals.io)  **Twitter**: [https://twitter.com/AnimalPlanetGFi](https://twitter.com/AnimalPlanetGFi)  **Facebook**: [https://www.facebook.com/AnimalPlanetNFT](https://www.facebook.com/AnimalPlanetNFT)  **Telegraph**: [https://t.me/AnimalPlanetNFTOfficial](https://t.me/AnimalPlanetNFTOfficial)  **E-mail**: [partners@planetofanimals.io](mailto:partners@planetofanimals.io)",0.9973,0.014,0.849,0.137
"Just want to let you know that if you're new to NFTs and scared (like most of us are), check out the Ei:gnetum NFTs on Solana. This is not just another soulless shill but I find the small small community and the project itself as the perfect start to dive into the NFT world.  1. It's on Solana, so no horrendous transaction fees when buying/selling/listing/bidding (don't worry, I love ethereum but as a beginner and non-millionaire it's just refreshing now and then when you don't have to pay crazy money just to buy a offing jpeg off of OpenSea) 2. The art is actually nice, most people in the community actually buy these because the eggs are great, hand-made and really nice to look at. Sure, number go up would be great but I am (and many others are) actually super happy buying these without having to worry if they'll be up or down in price tomorrow. 3. The slack channel is small, friendly, easy to navigate, and the designers very engaging. It's the first ever NFT community I really participate and as a beginner in the NFT world it really feels like a great entrance point into the crazy absurd world of NFTs and their communities. 4. Last but not least, let's talk about potential (Blabla sure $$$ counts, I know): there are 333 individually designed eggs, each of them is a 1/1, the initial mint was sold out in 8 minutes,  no stupid rarity hierarchy, all of them look f\*cking fantastic and it's a legit NFT project with some interesting features (e.g. blank eggs that get individually designed based on your wishes, supporting charities like The Ocean Cleanup project, etc.). The potential for boom is definitely there, be early, engage in our small family-like 🥚 community and don't be a 🐓. 5. Don't mind me talking, just check it out yourself, at the end of the day you either feel the 🥚 vibe or not, honestly it's up to you: @ eigentumNFT / [https://www.eigentum.art](https://www.eigentum.art) 6.

"Since I can remember, football clubs and individual football players have actively participated in charity activities, with or without UNICEF's aid. This has involved assisting young people and children and increasing awareness about the importance of sport and the quality of life among them.     I feel that the NFT community has a remarkable ability to support charities and give opportunity to players as well, especially from third world countries to have better training conditions. It's great to see that several sports NFT initiatives have actively invested money in young players by selling NFTs, which was nearly impossible five years ago. Individuals have opportunities for personal growth, training, and, most importantly, realizing their dreams. According to what I've heard so far, K-Club NFT plans on doing that, and if so, we're in for a whole new kind of football involvement.     As a Football Manager game fan (playing since 2004) there is something that totally amazed me and changed my perception or let's say possibly gave us (regular fans) an opportunity to participate in club's decision in real life. It looks like that you as a holder, for example, will be directly involved in transfer decisions, trainer decisions and board decisions. You become like a part of a club, man, it really took me time to catch up on this information and see did I understood well because that's awesome! Honestly, I don't need VR games if they gonna provide us with a real life experience.     Although the part about assisting young football players is fantastic, I was most surprised by the other part! Are there any similar initiatives? It certainly made my day. I'm really interested to see whether anything comparable exists and how they'll progress.",0.9973,0.0,0.75,0.25
"One day I found this account on Twitter called King Dogelamane and it turned out to be a group of amazing medieval stuff fans that have been working on a game called Crypto Lands. I loved this project and supported it as much as I could.  But all of sudden the project was quiet and it was quiet for a very long time I think It was something like 2 months. Nothing from them, no word, and no progress were shown to us in their dc channel. It looked very promising, they have sent us many screen-shots of their project progressing day by day, we have gained new members every day but still no word from them.  Then on Twitter, they have announced that two of their Team Members are in a hospital suffering from the coronavirus. We as a team of supporters were there for them but a few days ago They have announced one of their Team Members have apparently passed away due to the coronavirus. It concerns me if this is actually real or if they have been hacked. But it seems like it is actually true and it is heartbreaking to see such a great project go down in a few days due to the coronavirus.  I think if everything would turn out great the project would look amazing today and they would even release their promised play to earn the game. But They have only released 11 of the promised Knights as symbolism to us their supporters and are priced at 0.01ETH which is very cheap if you take into consideration all the other NFT Collections and projects.  I think this is very sweet of them they honor their supporters and every knight holds the name of one OG supporter and all of the profits go to the Team Member's family that they have lost.

"Hi all!  I recently started working on a generative art project. Nothing to do with apes, sharks, animals or characters; my project is all about contemporary art.  More specifically, I created an algorithm that generates infinite, unique contemporary variations of given musical pieces; I then hand-picked some of those generated variations as they sounded quite good. I also have a way to visually represent those. There is a whole story behind the scenes as to why exactly those generations are quite interesting to hear and visualize, but no need to get too much into detail here.  My objective is to transform this into a NFT project, by showcasing a collection of those curated unique pieces. Initially, I thought of transforming this project into something that would be suitable on a platform such as Artblocks, so anyone could get their own version of the story (which I love the concept by the way). But unfortunately, the algorithm I created has many constraints that won't make it Artblocks-friendly (coded in Python, quite heavy pipeline, relies on external libraries and specific source files, etc.).  So, let's say I have my assets (graphical and audio pieces). I started creating an Instagram account to explain the journey behind this and I am currently working on a simple visual website that would act as a gallery for those hand-picked digitally-generated pieces. The idea would be to link this website directly to a NFT marketplace, where those pieces would be available for sale.  I do have sufficient skills in programming and design to handle the whole ""creative"" process from A to Z (the algorithm, the curation, the graphical visualization, the gallery-like website). But I lack some knowledge on how to make this an actual NFT project–as my objective is to create a NFT collection out of those curated pieces.  * Do you guys have recommendations on which NFT marketplace to go for in this scenario? Ideally, I would like not to invest too much upfront as I do not have much money to dump into such a project, which I don't expect massive sales afterwards anyway. I thought maybe OpenSea with Polygon would be a good idea? If I understand correctly, this would require zero fees upfront? * Is it actually a good practice to create such a ""display-only"" website, with links to OpenSea? Should I rely on other ways here? I feel like this allows me to fully express my creative mind, as the gallery website itself is part of the experience in some sense. * Any resources to help me gain knowledge on how to create an audience that would be interested in such a project? I feel like many NFT marketing processes seem to revolve around creating some fun, exclusive-type hype like the well-known ape-collectible storyline which is not exactly what I am trying to do here. This NFT project would most importantly be a journey into a visual and contemporary world to begin with; any idea of communities where I can start showcasing this?    Many thanks!

On the other hand, I come to share a great art collection inspired by a play2earn game called ""Splinterlands"", which is a decentralized collectible card game built on the Hive blockchain, in order to grant fun and rewards to its players with awesome 1 vs 1 battles, tournaments and guild battles.  This collection is based on this great game, however, it is 100% original art in tribute to my favorite card game which is ""Splinterlands, with which I seek to allocate the funds obtained from the sale of the same, to increase my collection of cards in this great game, in addition, each comes for 4 rarities that directly impact the price of the NFT, so the rarities are as follows:  * NFT rarity ""Common"" * NFT rarity ""Rare * NFT rarity ""Epic"" * NFT rarity ""Legendary""  This collection is exclusive, and every week I hope to upload more artwork like this, with different rarities increasing the number of NFT in this collection. Also, it is important to note that:  **10% of the profits from the sales will go to the Official Project ""Splinterlands ""**, in order to continue supporting the growth of its platform and this great blockchain game. On the other hand, I must clarify that the material to make this collection is owned by ""Splinterlands.io, which is open source.  ***Below is the link to enter the collection on the ""Opensea"" platform.***  [Splinterlandsfansart](https://opensea.io/collection/splinterlandsfansart)  [https://opensea.io/collection/splinterlandsfansart](https://opensea.io/collection/splinterlandsfansart)",0.9977,0.016,0.713,0.272
"*DIGITAL x PHYSICAL x COLLECTABLE x UPGRADABLE x PLAYABLE*  The cryptocurrency and NFT industry has rapidly transformed the landscape of what exactly a collectable asset can be. With the rise of notable Profile Picture NFT’s such as Bored Ape Yacht Club, Azuki, and Cool Cats, it’s easy to throw around the word “collectable” in this industry. This is where Happy Robot Friends comes in.  **Happy Robot Friends** by mythic creative, is a collection of 3333 adorable humanoid NFT collectables that bridge the digital and the physical realm \[phygital\].  **Introducing P2U: PLAY 2 UPGRADE.**  The idea behind their artwork is to let the upgradable aspect shine through, and bridge the divide between two established but not yet connected worlds. Owners of the NFT’s are able to upgrade their images through a playable web platform, and also own a physically upgradeable version of their collectable.  Whereas most NFT’s, the rarity is determined by luck of the draw, this collection differs; rarity is earned.  Each season of the game lasts for 10 rounds. The faster each round is cleared, the higher the ranking and the higher rewards. The metadata is permanently saved into the blockchain, and available to be accessed on any secondary market such as Opensea.  Their roadmap promises multiple seasons of rewards and staking in the future. In a world where digital meets physical, earning passive income from your collectables and digital art is the future.  The team behind this collection is consists of award winning artists , designers, and entrepreneurs. Their vision for the brand is to maintain a long term player and collector base, expanding the community through notable partnerships with both NFT and non NFT brands, similar to Funko Pops with industry leaders like Marvel Entertainments.  From April 15th, one can purchase Happy Robot Friends NFT’s starting at 0.1 ETH each. The development team behind the brand uses the ERC721A blockchain contract technology that Azuki used to lower transaction fees, to ensure affordability. Furthermore the security behind the ranking system combines a hybrid on-off chain strategy to provide the highest level of security for the platform.

"**Creating the Art**  This is usually the easiest part to some degree. If you're an artist who already has a backlog of designs that you could turn into an NFT, then this step will take no time at all. This also goes for creators who have content produced or designers who have a strong handle on Adobe Suite products.  However, if you don't have a design background or don't have anyone who may want to be involved in the project that does, there are platforms where you can find designers to help for a cost.    1. Behance - Designer Dependant (inbox them for prices) 2. Dribbble - Designer Dependant (inbox them for prices) 3. Fiver - Depending on what you want, the price can start at as little as $50 USD 4. Upwork - Hourly rate based, approx of $15-20/per hour for a designer  Before going to these sites and sending inquiries, it's important to have the following penciled down otherwise you're wasting your time and the designers. This doesn't mean you need to know every single detail, but a general idea of the below will make this process A LOT easier for both parties.    1. Style of design you like, gather some inspiration (visit Pinterest, OpenSea, Reddit, etc) 2. Your budget (Keep in mind there are other costs for minting etc) 3. The amount of NFT's you want to create  \----------------------------------------------  **Choosing a Marketplace**  Now that you have your NFT art ready, it’s time to mint it and put it up for sale. For this, you need an NFT marketplace that supports the blockchain of your choice. There are a few options when looking for the right fit, so researching Ethereum, Solana, Tezos, and Algorand are great starting points.  One of the biggest differences between Ethereum and the rest would come down the gas fees, security, and active users.  You can find previous threads at /WhatTheNFT that provide great insight into the marketplaces on these blockchains and where may suit best for your NFT collection.  \----------------------------------------------  **Pricing (How much should I charge?)**  There are some factors that contribute to this and it's not always an easy task. If you're new to the NFT space, it’s better to start at a lower price. Once you have established yourself, you can increase the prices of your future collections or drops.  The golden rule most creators follow is to never mint their artwork if the gas fees are more expensive than the artwork itself. Many NFT projects also offer extra benefits for holders such as membership benefits, metaverse land, exclusive merch, and events, among others. In such scenarios too, you can price your NFT higher (this is a little more advanced, but content creators are looking to build in access to their NFT drops, so it's still relevant in some cases).  \----------------------------------------------  **Minting**  Minting an NFT is how your digital art becomes a part of the blockchain–a public ledger that is unchangeable and tamper-proof.  Each marketplace will have its own steps to mint NFTs. Here are the basic steps you have to follow:    1. Create a digital file of your NFT art and make sure the file format is supported by your marketplace of choice. 2. Create an account on the marketplace, connect your wallet, and click the create option (this may be placed different, depending on the marketplace) 3. Upload your file, give a name and description, and add properties and unlockable content (if available).  4. Lastly, click create and you are all set!  The other alternative is **Lazy Minting**.    Put simply, lazy minting is when an NFT is available 'off-chain' and only gets minted once there is a sale of the NFT. This means that the artist doesn't have to pay any upfront gas fees to mint their NFT. Another way to look at lazy minting is to see it as a way to defer the payment of gas fees until the NFT is sold. This really only makes sense though if you are going to use Ethereum, as gas fees can be very pricey at times.  \----------------------------------------------  Hope this gives beginners a solid idea of costs and considerations when creating an NFT or collection. Minting fees and marketplace costs vary, so you will need to do a little research on your end. But this gives you a framework you can start to work towards.

"   The NFT is a UNIQUE Tommy Hollenstein painting. He is painting an extremely large artwork 20x400 feet. There will be 1k pieces cut into 10k pieces and digitized. Each piece will be sold as an NFT. Checkout the DRIVE above to see! **People will get an NFT + The Physical Artwork in the post!**  **Why is it different?**  Tommy's painting is one of the first fine art NFT out there. No one has a project on the scale of Tommy's. Tommy's painting is one of the largest paintings ever made.   The quality of art with the sheer scope of it all is unmatched in the world.   **Some NFT’s will be uniquely rare, and signed by celebrities like Ringo Star - Anyone has the chance to own one!** **AND People will get an NFT + The Physical Artwork in the post!**  **Why should people invest in the token? What are their benefits?**     Tommy's paintings are purchased by many wealthy people and famous celebrities. Also the story behind Tommy is incredibly motivating. One of the benefits of buying the NFT is the ability to get the physical copy too after holding onto the NFT for a certain amount of time. The logistics are still being worked around but you will get the physical.      **Why are you guys better than other NFTs?**  The painting itself is higher quality then any NFT in the market. Tommy's painting is considered fine art, and there will be certain NFTs that are painted by celebrities too like Ringo Star.  Most NFT projects are computer generated or low quality artworks. This piece is real fine art. It is done by a legitimate professional artist. Another thing that makes this unique is the fact that you can get the physical piece alongside the digital. It is not often done where you can get both.       **Who is the team? Why are they amazing and trustworthy? What makes them capable of delivering?**   The team is Joseph Silva as the project manager, Samual Moegenburg, Cassidy Barnette, and the Dreamcenter. The Dreamcenter is an amazing non profit that has been around 27 years and have helped over 7 million people. They are providing the studio and the general labor to get this project working.  **Big partners?**  The Dreamcenter is the beneficiary, a massive non profit that has been around for 27 years.

This means there will be 10k unique NFTs.   **Why are the tokens worth buying?**   Tommy is one of the most inspirational people you will ever meet. His story of perseverance with his disability and how he never gave up no matter what his situation brought him in, is truly unique.

"Chances are, you may have been scammed when you started out. It's so commonplace in crypto and NFTs that I wanted to make a shortlist of things beginners can do to avoid them, or at least limit the impact they may have when navigating this decentralized landscape.  **Turn off your Di-sc-ord DM's.**  These are literally the most common NFT scams out there. Let's point out some that exist.  1. Hackers gain administrator access and post fake minting links in the announcement channel imposing as an actual organizer or founder. Usually targeting sold-out collections as there will be demand from those who missed out. Additional mint almost NEVER happens. 2. When beginners ask for genuine help through general chat, they will receive multiple DM's with imposters acting as customer support. Project teams will NEVER message you first and will typically have a ticketing system built into their server. 3. Imposter accounts sending you direct DM's promoting other collections, raffles you've apparently won, or early access to minting the NFT project of the server you are part of.  **Don't give ANYONE your private key. Seriously, ever.**  This is an obvious one but for many people, the idea of being able to buy the mansion and the car allows all common sense to be thrown out of the window. It doesn't matter what the offer is, who is trying to help you, how much APY you could make...for the love of Christ, **DON'T EVER GIVE ANYONE YOUR PRIVATE KEY/SEED PHRASE. EVER.**  You will wake up with $0 left in your bank account after the scammers have drained every cent out of your account. I've seen it happen before to friends, it's a very sad sight to see. This applies to phishing through Discor, Twitter, Instagram, Telegram, basically any social platform that promotes the space.  I would suggest beginners buy a cold wallet that stores your crypto &amp; NFT's off-grid, it's the safest way to store your assets.  **Beware the airdrops.**  Airdrops can have malicious coding in them as well. Scammers will usually send the airdrop to random wallets with the name being the website where most will go to try and sell them. Easy money, right? Wrong. Everything is programmable and they will make them unsellable. Basically locking you into something that forces you to give them access to your funds. Your best bet here is to just ignore them. Simple.  Also be mindful that dodgy projects airdrop their shitcoins or NFT projects to influencers or celebrities, giving them the ability to claim ""said person of interest"" is a holder. This happens fairly often, so the simple rule is to just ignore any social news of this on project websites or articles.  **Rugs are great in a house, but not in Web 3.0.**  Fake, or half-baked collections, have become a huge issue. OpenSea has just advised that almost 80% of projects on their platform are either fakes, scams, rip-off collections, or something in that lane. Rug pulls are and always have been prominent in the crypto/NFT space.  What is a rug pull for beginners in a space? It's when a person or group of people release an initial project or currency with the promise of rolling our additional perks and utility that will unfold over time. They would then run off with the money well before any of those ""promises"" can take place.  In crypto, it's common to see influencers promoting a project or token (knowing it's worthless), one in which they hold assets. When their audience starts to buy it, they sell into that spike in NFT or token price, essentially leaving the new holders high and dry with an asset that is now worthless. The influencer walks away with millions, while the new holders are left with nothing. Be careful!  If you have fallen for a scam, don't be hard on yourself. Visit [revoke.cash](https://revoke.cash/), a tool that checks which websites have permissions to engage with a wallet and lets you revoke permissions. This doesn't reimburse you, but it may help in this happening again or provide a slight chance to stop the hacker before he has a chance to set his plan in motion.  **Question everything, and EVERYONE.**  The biggest thing is to look for fully doxxed teams that are made up of reputable figures who have openly identified themselves. This is one of the most sound ways to know if the project leads are serious or if they will hide in the shadows waiting to rug you.  Things to ask before jumping in would be:  1. What is their reputation in the space? 2. Has the project been audited by a reputable auditor? (Certik is usually the best) 3. Have they worked on successful drops in the past? (What's their track record) 4. Who is the artist? 5. Does the art translate well? 6. How active are the community and what type of discussion are being had?  You'll find A LOT of celebrities get paid to endorse or promote bad projects. One great example was Jake Paul, who promoted a pump and dump. Even if the celebrity promotes it like they're personally involved in the project. Be extremely cautious.  **Lastly, be prepared to lose everything.**  This one is super simple in my opinion, but many refuse to acknowledge this simple guideline.  Only invest what you can afford to lose. If you can comfortably have that money sitting in an asset for 12 months or longer, knowing that all your expenses and lifestyle won't suffer then it's probably a safe amount. This goes for everyone.  That feeling you get in your stomach when your crypto crashes or NFT projects fail to provide any return, that's the feeling of someone who invested more than they could afford to lose. Don't be that person.  The other great rule is to NEVER invest in anything that you don't truly understand. That's literally gambling. There is a difference between Poker and roulette. One requires some strategy and understanding, the other is left to the gods themselves. Get the knowledge and understand first, the rest will come in time.  \-------------------------------------------------  I hope this helps all the beginners out there who are thinking of getting into this space. There is a huge amount of opportunity, but also a huge amount of bad projects. The research will always be your best friend and question. literally. everything. #WAGMI",0.9981,0.084,0.764,0.153
"The Ape Project is an NFT collection that makes cryptocurrency daily for its holders. It doesn't just generate any old token either... Our team has created our own Reflection Token called $VARIABLE that is built on the Ethereum Network and seamlessly swaps to ETH on UniSwap (video proof of this in our DiscordServer). But what is a Reflection Token and why is it much more incredible than a standard ERC20 token? Essentially, the holders of our $VARIABLE token will receive MORE $VARIABLE just for owning it.  *Even if you're not staking your NFT's*... *Just owning $VARIABLE will automatically give you more of it because it's a reflection token.*  If you want to learn more about this process, we layout specifics in our whitepaper here:  [https://the-ape-project.gitbook.io/variable/](https://the-ape-project.gitbook.io/variable/)  So how do you get $VARIABLE?  Of course, you can buy and sell it like any other cryptocurrency on UniSwap and other platforms but our NFT holders will receive it automatically when staking their apes on our staking platform (pictures on this down below).

While we do have phenomenal art, this project is about much more than cool art... It's about technology, community, and the chance you really show people that NFT tech can be so much more than owning digital pictures.  This is also the reason we've developed what we refer to as The Governance...  The Governance is the governing body of The Ape Project made up by real community members. The members of The Governance will essentially be the founders of the project moving forward. Members will meet with us (the creators) via audio chat in a private channel in our DiscordServer once a month. They will help to decide what happens to the appearance of the apes when we start running experiments in The Lab. During Phase 6 of our Roadmap, you will see that we introduce what we call ""The Others""... This is the second drop or ""collection"" of apes that will join The Ape Project. Members of The Governance will be able to customize their own apes to be whatever they want because those members will get their apes airdropped/gifted to them for being loyal members of The Governance.  ***Ever wanted to create your own 1 of 1 custom NFT? Now you can...***  Members will also help us create the other apes for the rest of the community and help drive the storyline moving forward. On top of this, members of The Governance will have a chance to win $1,000 a day for a year. We will be choosing one random Governance member every day for a year to win $1,000. You can win as many times as possible, just not two days in a row. In other words, you definitely want to be in The Governance. How do you get in??? You buy 5 Apes or more. You must maintain ownership of at least 5 Apes to stay in The Governance. This will also increase the floor price and longevity of the project by introducing supply shock early and keeping holders engaged with the project long-term.  On top of this, more rare apes will generate more $VARIABLE than a common ape moving forward. If you're in The Governance you will automatically get a super rare 1 of 1 ape in the second drop so this is another great perk for those of you who decide to be a part of the team.  Now, what can you do with all the $VARIABLE you're earning???  Well, since we did say this was about tech and community, the first thing you can do is use your $VARIABLE to buy our NFT's from all future drops/mints....  1. You can take your original apes and buy more of them with the $VARIABLE it earns you. 2. You can instantly claim your $VARIABLE without unstaking your apes and then swap it for ETH on UniSwap if you choose to cash out... In the meantime, your apes that are still staked will continue to create more $VARIABLE for you. 3. You can hold the $VARIABLE for a long-term investment just like any other cryptocurrency that you currently buy and hold. Rember, it's going to be tradable on Uniswap so anyone can buy and sell it just like ETH.  We have so much more to this project and want to share it with you so if you're interested in learning more about The Ape Project and what we're doing for our community you can visit our website here:  [www.ApeProject.io](https://www.apeproject.io/)",0.9983,0.01,0.864,0.125
"Everyone is so focused on Music NFTs being ownership tokens, but the real value will be in utility and direct connection to the artist. This is nothing new for Music. Let me give a example:  let's say you buy a limited edition signed vinyl. it comes with a front row ticket to the show, a meet n greet, and a tshirt. you go to the signing...you get to meet the artist and get your collectible vinyl! it's great, even to say a few words to this artist. you really enjoy their music, you just want to say thank you.  its a great experience. you carefully take it home your signed collectible vinyl and make sure its in perfect condition.  the show sold out, now the ticket that came with the vinyl is worth $200!  You sell it to someone from work because you can't make it. It's an hour away anyway. You're glad you could make it to the signing tho.  ***Now its 10 years later.*** Your concert days are more limited now, but you still love the music. You find that old tshirt, still in perfect condition in the back of your closet. Its worth $250 on StockX. Wow!  Next, you think about your prized vinyl. Signed and still in mint condition. You see that the signed collectible vinyl is worth $1000 on eBay. Wow! You think to yourself about how funny that is. You listen to the music on Spotify or watch on Youtube every once in a while. For the most part, the vinyl has been gathering dust in your collection. But thats okay, it's like an old trophy to you. Maybe you'll frame it one day. You decide to hang on to it. You love having it, and plus if its worth $1000 now...imagine another 10 years later?  Did any part of this have to do with owning this music?  Did you ever think you owned the music?  Music NFT is just like these products. The Music NFT itself is like a digital vinyl with a lifetime access ticket to irl and virtual events/shows/community. Also, **Music NFTs deliver the same products listed above.** Its a way to go directly to fans and let them pay in crypto. It's a new way to deliver a product package. It doesn't have to be an ownership token to create huge value.",0.9987,0.014,0.748,0.239
"We are all aware that the NFT craze has created enormous excitement, the fact is that digital arts have become popular as a result of them, at least it seems so to me, what do you think?     In recent years, NFTs have become popular in art, music, gaming, sports, and entertainment, but somehow I like them the most in art, especially when I discovered some great NFT artists such as XCOPY, Hackatao, Mad Dog Jones, etc. I'm so into this urban street art, that's how I found cool some street art projects and initiatives.      Remember how great was that Street Art Festival which used NFTs to help rebuild an underserved Mexican village, I really love it when it has some good cause such as the case with this festival, NFTs could do a lot of good if you present them in a good way. Sk8coin platforms offer great things as well, they provide DIY skateparks to talented young skateboarders and they support professional skateboarders by funding them for their skate camps or training resources.      So, there are some very cool projects that help other people and that's a beautiful thing and I'm very happy to find out about these types of initiatives. The combination of something I love so much as street art, in this case, something useful and something that brings good to others is the perfect mix if you ask me. What is NFT project brings you the perfect mix?",0.9989,0.017,0.625,0.358
"Hello there fellow crypto artists, would love to start a discussion and introduce myself firstly beforehand! There are 2 parts to this discussion, this is the first part.  A bit about myself, I am a new artist that have been currently more into the crypto world and curiously researching and learning about NFTs in the crypto world, and till date I’ve understood quite a handful about NFT and it’s basic concepts. To tell you about my personal interest, I am a plant lover 🌱, and I have lots of different kinds of plants in my home! As I came to know about NFTs, being a plant lover, I thought of working on something that combines the 2 and puts it to use! Currently NFT artist (creator/designer) and looking to collect as well!   Moving on to the topic of our discussion, using plants as NFTs and the Metaverse, before we dive into it I would like to discuss about plants in general at first. Why did I choose plants? I personally feel plants have a really big value, and even in the real world plants are very helpful and do a lot of things for us. The most basic function of plants is to take in carbon dioxide, some of it from our exhales and the rest from environment, and it will produce oxygen, which we will inhale into our bodies. This is why I feel we must have more of plants and multiply them as they are oxygen producers and so their role is very vital in the real world which increases the value they have and the rarity of plants, as apart from oxygen producers we are able to make herbal food and items, medicines, veggies, fruits, edibles all from different kinds of plants!!  Now that we have established the value and rarity of plants and their value in the real world, how about the NFT world, or even the Metaverse! Looking back, in the real world there are many people who don’t understand the importance of plants and thus don’t value them and appreciate them enough, and the appreciation and understanding of plants is far less in the NFT world and Metaverse as well, it’s rarely seen, therefore it has been my aim as a plant lover to introduce the idea and concept of plants in the NFT world and Metaverse as well!  As part of realising my dream, I’d also really love to create a whole new plant NFT Community where plant lovers and all other enthusiasts can collaborate and interact with each other in the community, and together work towards making plants the next big thing in both the NFT world and Metaverse! Through this we can achieve a world where people are able to appreciate plants, admire them and understand it’s rarity and the value it holds!  Think about plants as NFTs, holding them could give you the feel of having plants with you accessible all the time, and I hope that plants as NFTs and plants in the metaverse will make it to the news, so in turn the effect this would have is for more people to understand and appreciate plants which will make my dream a success! So holding plant NFTs also contributes to this as well!  Now thinking about plants in the Metaverse, firstly all the visualisations of Metaverse that I’ve seen so far are lacking depictions of nature and most importantly plants, and because of this the huge NFT Community which is into the Metaverse will not fully understand and appreciate the value of plants and spread awareness, therefore to achieve this the introduction of plants into the Metaverse is necessary, specifically plant as an NFT so that plant NFT holders can participate in the metaverse and understand plants’ importance, which in turn makes them appreciate its value therefore spreading awareness and so more people will know!  Now that I’ve put out my discussion and covered plant as NFTs and the Metaverse, I’d like to thank you all for reading so far and putting in your effort to understand, hopefully you guys can share your thoughts and ideas on this discussion and we can learn more together!  The 2nd part of this discussion is based on a special type of plant which is rare, known as succulents! Stay tuned for the 2nd part of discussion which will be coming out within few hours!  Thanks again for going through my discussion, hopefully you all learnt something and help by spreading awareness of plants, contributing towards creating a new, big and strong plant NFT Community!",0.999,0.0,0.834,0.166
"Hi all! In this thread I will share my experience and sometimes ask for advice about NFT.   Let me tell you right away, my main goal is to understand what it is and how it works. I think I've read a million articles and watched as many video reviews on this topic. But I'm still left with questions and still mush in my head!   So, as I understand it - the most interesting NFTs are the digital pieces. And this is not my strong point - I can draw on paper, and although I work with Adobe for work, but I do not consider this to be my strong point.  Nevertheless, I will now tell you why I want to try to sell my NFTs and what they are about.  I am very close to the essence of NFT - something unique and something that cannot be replaced by anything else. It seems to me that all pieces of art, whether paintings or photographs, are unique. Reproductions are great, of course, but still not the original.   A couple of years ago I wondered what I could give my friends for New Year's Eve - I wanted to find something unique, from the heart, and sweet. I remembered the cards that my mom used to get from her friends at Christmas, New Year's, and other holidays. They were very pretty - snow-covered winter landscapes and heartfelt captions. But I didn't like the store cards, they were too corny. And then the idea hit me - to draw them myself. And now I send my friends gouache-painted cards, each with a unique and unrepeatable storyline. I look for the most beautiful and unusual landscapes, I am inspired and create my own versions. And I think they are perfect for the NFT.   You know what I mean? The only version of the paper postcard is embodied in a digital version in also a single and unique copy. I think it's the perfect option.   And the second option for my collection is the sky. The most banal, the most unique, the most accessible and the most free and the most underrated that there is in the world. The sky is always so free, so strange, so magical and beautiful - that the vista loses in comparison. When I got my first soapbox, and then my iPhone, I took pictures of the sky. I have accumulated many photos of the sky: winter, cloudy, sunny, pre-thunderstorm, summer. And in the clouds you can guess the images - here's a bear cub, and here's a bunny.   It's a little childish, isn't it? I agree. But it seems to me that being a little naive in our difficult and sometimes difficult times is very important. It's important to find something positive in every day, to enjoy the little things and not miss a single opportunity to live: communicate with friends, walk in the woods, look at nature and enjoy it. Cherish it and love it, draw inspiration and strength.   Yesterday I decided to try to put my pictures on OpenSea and I faced some problems, so I ask for your help and advice. For some reason, I am not able to do an auction and put the amount less than 2 units. I can not understand where I went wrong.   Well, and of course, I would be grateful for advice, support. If I manage to sell at least one work, I will have an incentive to realize my long-time dream - to buy a professional camera and take a photography course in order to organize my knowledge. Yes, I have a small impostor compass, I almost never studied drawing and photography and I am not very confident in my abilities and talent.   So, thanks for all the comments, opinions and advice. I am attaching one of my postcards, which I will soon put up for sale in NFT format",0.999,0.063,0.719,0.217
"Hello Reddit community!  As you could already see the title, I ask the community for help to help me meet the woman of my dreams.    To go into details, I will tell you my story with this woman. First I'll tell you a little about myself.    My name is Alan, I live in Argentina, I am Argentinian, I am currently delving into NFT art at Rarible, I am passionate about electronic music, more specifically the ""progressive house"" genre (such as the one played by Hernan Cattaneo, Guy J, among others) and ""melodic house techno"". My favorite duo is ARTBAT, I love their music.    So as not to bore you with me, now I'm going to tell you the story.    At least 3 years ago, I started having several busy dreams where a woman appeared next to me. Each dream was different, no matter if bad things happened, good things, laughter, tears, whatever, she was always by my side, accompanying me in all kinds of moments, holding my hand, being my companion. Every time she appeared, I felt a great love for her, something deep-rooted, that always led me to her.    But there was a problem, he could only know her height, the color of her hair, which was blonde, except for the last time, where she was red. Her height was almost similar to mine, a little shorter than me. Her face, he couldn't see it.  Upon awakening from each dream, I cannot describe the level of nostalgia and anguish I felt, knowing that I did not know her, I did not know who she was, but I knew very strongly that at some point I was going to meet her. It was very distressing to know that you met the love of your life and when you woke up he was gone, as if he didn't exist.  Years passed and I kept dreaming of her, until for at least half a year I stopped dreaming of her.  Until November 2021 arrives.  Already several of her dreams were dispersing in her memory and several of them I remember with great difficulty, I thought I was not going to see her again. Until one day, she appears again... This time, if she could see her face, her hair, her height, everything was there, she could see her. She came up to me and looked me in the face. I knew it was her, since the emotions and everything, was what always generated me when I saw her.    A week after that dream, I meet her. I found her through Facebook, at first, I could only see some photos and I wasn't very sure. A few days later he accepts my request and I can see more photos. And yes...it was her. He couldn't believe it, anyway, he was quite skeptical of what was happening.  We started talking, the connection was instantaneous, only a few days passed and the connection was so great that I felt the need to tell her, she took it well and for her it was something very strange, very magical at the same time. She told him some of my dreams, and there were coincidences with things that happened in her life.  For example once I dreamed that she was kidnapped from her and I saved her from her. She told me that once they tried to kidnap her.  Weeks passed and love was growing in a very accelerated way. I have met several women in my life, but I never had a connection as fluid and as fast as this one, I felt like a child for letting myself be carried away so much by emotions.     Since then, I don't stop thinking every day of the possible ways to see it. I wake up and go to bed just thinking about her. We know that the connection we have goes beyond everything, we spend 24 hours talking and even sometimes without telling me, I know how she feels or she knows how I feel without telling her. From the first day to today, I have known almost her entire life, I have known her sadness and her laughter. We believe that we know each other from past lives, since several dreams that she had were from other times. The truth is that I don't know how real these things are, but this is what is happening to me and it is not something invented, I could easily invent a more credible story and not as crazy as this one, but this is reality.    The problem is that she lives in Spain, I in Argentina. My economic situation is not the best, I am not in a position to travel. That's why this is where I came up with the idea of ​​asking the community for help. **BUT NOT TO ASK THEM TO GIVE ME ANYTHING.**    I have created a collection of NFT art in Rarible, with the sole objective of raising the necessary money to be able to travel and settle there for a few months. We wish with much love to meet each other, it's been almost 6 months since we started talking and we are very excited to meet each other. I know and we know that things may be different when we see each other, but at least we want to try, I want to try. I can't stay living with the idea that the woman of my dreams, I could only meet her through a screen.    Community, I ask for her great support, so that you can help me spread my NFT collection pieces, share this story and my posts on my social networks so that my art reaches potential buyers.     Currently I am also thinking of creating an NFT collection with her (Lury)(the woman of my dreams). So stay tuned!    If all goes well, I will upload updates of this great odyssey of love. Today for me, tomorrow for you. I wish you all the best and thank you for making it to the end of this short true story. Please help me share my digital arts. I love you♥     **I leave the links so you can follow me and share on the networks.**    My collection on Rarible: [https://rarible.com/deepfrequency/](https://rarible.com/deepfrequency/)  My main and personal profile: [https://www.instagram.com/im.alandeep/](https://www.instagram.com/im.alandeep/)  Twitter: [https://twitter.com/DeepFrequency7](https://twitter.com/DeepFrequency7)  My artistic Instagram profile: [https://www.instagram.com/deepfrequency.nft/](https://www.instagram.com/deepfrequency.nft/)",0.9992,0.044,0.789,0.167
"I always find it funny that people are so quick to call NFTs a scam when it's a space that is so new and still finding its feet in Web 3,0. Funnily enough, it's always towards the trading component and never about use cases outside of this niche within the space. Usually, because they have no idea of the other utility that's being created and built.  It's undeniable that the list of use cases will continue to grow and they will become part of our lives over time. Some of the below are either happening now or will eventually become tangible in 2022-23.  **Vertical Marketplaces**  NFT projects will shift towards DTC marketplaces like larvalabs and SolanaMBS. Managing user experience is critical for retention, and eliminating 3rd parties doesn’t hurt.  **Soulbound NFT's**  NFTs are lauded for their transferability, but there are many use cases for non-transferable tokens: driver’s licenses, diplomas, certifications, proof of attendance, etc. Soulbound NFTs lock-in provenance, and can not be sold.  **Retail Sector**  Retailers from 7-11 to Gamestop will use NFTs to incentivize IRL transactions, leveraging creators to drive traffic to storefronts. For example, Yeezy NFTs that airdrop with purchases from Gap stores, or NFTs that unlock exclusive features for Tesla vehicles.  **Borrowing Platforms**  Because NFTs can unlock temporary access—like entry to conferences—markets for short-term lending are emerging. Imagine this as a marketplace: StubHub, but for NFTs.  **NFT Indexes**  Getting exposure to hundreds of NFTs via indexes will boom as market movers tap collectors for funds. Imagine a Christie’s NFT ETF. They have the influence to get assets to liquidity—investors will ape into that. It will also broaden support for NFT communities.  **Bounties**  Creators and brands will drop unique quests within communities, rewarding completion with NFTs. This could be anything from completing a questionnaire to referring members into the community, to attending events. Bounties can be highly competitive, or open wide.  **Social Investing**  Web3 streamlines investing by reducing manual processes like spreadsheet mgmt + signature collection. It also acts as a social record—startups like PartyRound will build networks around such activity, and reinforce them with NFTs.  **Legal**  The benefits of block security and its ability to trigger transactions via oracles will accelerate the adoption of web3 legal services + contract development. A DocuSign killer (or acquisition target) will be built in 2022, and it will deliver NFTs to contract executors.  **Services**  NFTs will unlock access to services and hobbyist communities. Q&amp;As and tutorials with influencer chefs, photographers, doctors, and niche enthusiastic communities will boom. This will also extend into IRL services like transportation, hotels, and spas.  **Content Submission**  Users will submit content like short-form videos, reviews, and tutorials in exchange for NFTs. It’s a marketing flywheel. Rights can be programmed into contracts so that the use of the contributor’s content in advertising could yield their future profits.  **Activism**  Communities, where NFT ownership supports political causes, will gain traction as millions flow into community wallets. Imagine environmental NFT collectives where sales are directed towards lobbying efforts, and those efforts are coordinated by a community DAO.  **Social Feed Marketplaces**  Social feeds based on NFT collections will emerge, providing insight into the strategy of top collectors, and a platform for collectors to interact. These feeds will evolve into social commerce marketplaces, featuring reviews, analytics, and more.  **Multiplayer**  NFTs will create hive activity by incentivizing group behavior. MMORPGs that unlock levels once 10k users have aped in. Airdrops of rare NFTs to collector cohorts that have signed contracts to merge their base-layer NFTs. Collecting is going to become a team sport.  **Collateralization**  To date, lenders have been averse to NFT holders borrowing against their assets. But as institutional money flows in, and assets become better stores of value, collateral markets will promise flexibility and liquidity for all NFT holders, not just whales.  **Fractionalization**  Splitting up NFTs into individual shares gives more people exposure to blue-chip assets, like owning a piece of a CryptoPunk. The result? More liquidity for holders and more appreciation of blue-chip assets as money enters the markets.  **DeFi**  As enthusiasts become more comfortable staking and farming their holdings for yield, NFTs promise incentives beyond APY%. NFTs will become base DeFi assets, with community access included. These won't be simple savings plays—they'll also be investments in communities.  **Loyalty Exchanges**  As brands and creators seek to reinforce loyalty, community behavior will be rewarded with NFTs. Did the member contribute content? NFT. Complete surveys? NFT. Make a purchase? NFT. Tokens are more liquid and bragworthy than traditional discount codes.  **R&amp;D**  Brands and creators will exchange NFTs for insights on product development: pain points, marketing claims, roadmap, and more. The NFTs will unlock early access to product releases and potential profit sharing. Brands will track and maintain these key relationships.  **Customer Cohort NFTs**  Imagine receiving an NFT for being one of the first Air Jordan customers, and how valuable that would be today. How Nike might reward you years later with special access and product. Cohort NFTs prove that you took a certain action, at a certain time.  **Education and Customer Support**  Upon demonstrating exceptional knowledge of a brand’s product, users can receive NFTs in exchange for onboarding newbies into the community, or providing support. This can be exponentially more impactful than a brand employee doing the same.  **Leaderboards**  NFT communities will gamify by highlighting the performance and participation of top holders. Top contributors will receive rewards and clout, thereby incentivizing communities to hold and participate in order to secure better returns on their investments.  \-------------------------------------------------------------  Take a second to actually look past the BS in the space and see that there is huge potential. #WAGMI",0.9993,0.025,0.807,0.168
"Bitcoin is great for what it is; A store of value.   Other cryptos are better at what Bitcoin inspired; Blockchain technology solving real-world problems. In the NFT community, you see the best, growing projects forming partnerships with each other. On the crypto side, though, you see more lines drawn that lead to toxic battles about who's the best.     I can't imagine being a Maxi for anything. Sure, Bitcoin is like the steak of the crypto world. I love steak, but I also love pasta( #ETH and #BNB ). Do you know what I love just as much of any of them? Dessert(NFTs).    It's cool to love your favorite project, but one project being awesome doesn't make another less awesome. If they both serve a need, they can both grow. Very likely together. A rising tide raises all ships. We see it exponentially in the blockchain world.    Bitcoin was created to be a decentralized peer to peer cash transfer system. Since it was the first in the space, it evolved into digital gold. It's the best store of value in the #Metaverse. However Bitcoin was the first blockchain, so it's primitive compared to current tech.    Bitcoin is clunky, slow, and pricey to move. It's similar to taking a gold bar to buy a u/Subway sandwich. Sure you could make a fair exchange of value, but cash serves that purpose more effectively. It's easier to measure and transport.    Coins like Ethereum, BNB, ALGO, SOLANA, and AVAX took this blockchain technology and adds a layer called smart contracts. Basically, coding that says ""if event A happens, then event B must happen.""  These coins all allow developers to use those smart contracts that solve real-world needs. or sometimes meme coins... ok, usually meme coins, but there are some major projects making waves.     We are seeing everything from air quality checks in #Miama being operting on the Algorand chain. I'm sure Mayor Francis Suarez has played a big part in that. We are also seeing people in underveloped countries making good lvings using NFTs in Play to earn games. P2E is huge right now on BNB and SOL.    One day major corporations will use the blockchains/smart contracts they operate on as advertisements. There will be ads that say ""Your mortgage loan powered by Ethereum."" or ""Earn a living with us playing on Solana"" maybe even ""Our school lets you track you kids from home to school to home using AVAX"".    Bitcoin will still have it's place though. We will see a time where countries have a monetary system backed by the Bitcoin standard. Countries like u/el Salvador are already leading the way to this with the help of Nayib Bukele.     Mass adoption makes this all possible. Each successful project is another stroke on the canvas to paint the picture of why blockchain integration with our lives makes sense. Let's all support every solid project. One project becoming successful only helps the other good projects     If you are looking for a rising project with some great partnerships, check out:     MagicEden.io/marketplace/SoLads",0.9994,0.006,0.727,0.267
