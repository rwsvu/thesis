"Hello, some people like reading, some like sports, as for me I like to mint NFTs everyday. It's something I find therapeutic in a beautifully bizarre way. I have two main collections I mint every single day:  1) daily sounds, yes as the name implies a new sound every single day. (have been minting for the past   83 days) I messed up day 73, because apparently if 100% of your collection is on polygon and you accidently mint on eth, ON the same collection! you don't get a warning,  but yeah I still take the blame on this one.  2) notes for millennia, a note a day that I've been minting for the past 110 days  I'm not making this up, [https://opensea.io/collection/notesformillennia](https://opensea.io/collection/notesformillennia)   So when opensea released their 50 item limit per collection I was unable to add items to both collections effectively destroying both collections.   As you can see here it says 13 hours ago instead of 1 day ago, I was asleep when opensea reversed their decision on the 50 item limit. meaning day 110 was minted after 00:00 GMT (all other NFTs were minted on a daily basis) the only silver lining is, day 110 was minted before midnight in NYC so I could follow that as my day definition, I'd still need to check if all the nfts were minted before NYC midnight which I'm not 100% sure of but it's likely as I usually mint when I get home from work.    https://preview.redd.it/jwks1ozrkge81.png?width=1894&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c758db6a9a03cdf82c602899a905e2be4c6fbd4c  Notes: Yes, I understand I should mint from contracts, I plan on doing so with the second volume which might be after day 365  I don't know if I want to keep minting anymore, I mean I probably will, but this has caused a severe mental blow to my momentum",0.2344,0.063,0.864,0.073

"Hi guys, I've been trading crypto for a while now, and have been following smart contracts ever since they were announced as a feature for Ethereum. However, something regarding recent developments with NFTs has been bothering me, mainly regarding the current image problem NFTs are facing, and I'd like a serious discussion about this, because I believe that the technology as a whole is facing a major risk of most people being permanently turned off by the mere mention of the word ""NFT"".  Inherently, from a computer science perspective, theres absolutely nothing wrong with NFTs. They are an important function of smart contracts that could be used as a means of decentralized transferrable ownership contracts... BUT....  What everyone (outside of this sub and others communities like this one) actually hates (warranted or unwarranted) is the most common implementation: selling JPG art for exorbitant sums of crypto. What should've been sidelined as gag after the proof-of-concept stage with CryptoKitties (no one complained about those, I'm just saying) became a sprawling ecosystem of extremely similar projects with everyone trying to cash in. I mean, ffs, these were supposed to be linked to smart contracts controlling ownership of real world items, people running their own stores, car rental/dealerships, real estate companies, banks, governments, etc, with no middlemen, no VISA/Paypal breathing down your neck the second you do something the Epsteins of the world don't like, you could set up a functioning economy connected to global infrastructure in third world countries with minimal setup. You even have this as the header for this sub, where are all of those projects? Why don't I see those types of projects being advertised heavily, yet I get a person in my DMs every single day telling me to mint BAYC version 937374929? I know this is ""early days, fast forward a few years and you'll see it"" but isn't it time already? When was that rule written, a few years ago? What's going on, devs?  Blockchain technology was supposed to put the collective power of the internet back in the hands of the many, but so far I have not seen this be the case, just more people selling for fiat instead of buying items for crypto outright. Selling for fiat should be done just to interact with the outdated government tax system at this point. For how long will this be tolerated? Hyper-inflation, corporate tyranny colluding with our government, massive corporations getting bailouts while small businesses are squeezed out, all this could be solved if we stop using a fiat banking currency, if we stop using centralized platforms and go back to the days of the wild west. Yes, it is more dangerous at first, because the surface of blockchain isn't fully built yet. But what's the most dangerous thing is if we continue on our current path while the foundation of our society crumbles under the surface of fiat infrastructure.   JPG NFTs are supposed to be proof of concepts. May we overcome this obsession upon our collective psyche, get out of our comfort zones, and climb out of the hellpit that is fractional reserve lending so that we can all be like kings in the new era, with no corporate authority telling us what we can or can't do within existing laws.  Anyway, that's been my rant. Sorry if I broke any rules or if this has been posted a million times but I just had to get this off my chest. If you have any real-world NFT projects you'd like to shill to me and everyone else, please do so in the comments below.",-0.9451,0.081,0.864,0.055

I work in the environment services business. All hazardous waste requires labeling and tracking using a manifest that must be signed by trained personnel. Waste manifest needs to be retained at least 5 years. I feel this would be a great use case for NFTs.  -Assign drum a waste NFT ID (included on label) -Only person with valid permissions can interact with NFT (ie up to date training) -When drum changes hands NFT ID label is scanned and ownership is digitally transferred creating an on-chain “chain of custody” -Results in real-time tracking of package and permanent record of custody transfer  You could even program a transaction to occur once waste is received by final person (ie disposal).
