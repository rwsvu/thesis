"This is something I've been working on since I read about how often NFTs go offline or get hijacked due to their externally hosted data, including those hosted on IPFS. My solution was to encode all the data, even the image data, on the blockchain itself. This produces an NFT that works with marketplaces and wallets, and requires no external hosting whatsoever. My NFTs and all their data last forever (well, as long as the blockchain lasts!).  I have created the randomizer function on-chain too so when you mint the NFT it is created on the chain too.    The first project using this is called BSC Donut Bunny and it uses Donut Tokens to mint the NFTs. Interested in what you think!

"""A lot of Sport Betting platforms claim to be DeFi but on closer examination, you find that they are truly not. For most, at best they give you the option to place bets using cryptocurrencies but remain very much centralized at their very core. They lack key features of a decentralized betting platform like no registrations, no KYC’s, lack of interference from regulatory bodies, and DOA governance via coin possession.  Currently, there is only one truly Defi Sports Betting Exchange and they are the first truly decentralized betting exchange. They are called Betswap.gg.  Betswap is powered by the Ethereum layer 2 Polygon. The platform utilizes a governance token ($BSGG). This token gives users voting power to shape the future of the platform. No centralized organization OR regulatory body to interfere, neither is there any registration or KYC required all that is required is a MetaMask wallet with some crypto in it.  So, there you go!

"Hello everyone I hope everyone is great and had a great year start  Now on our topic about the debate  As the title says am on a debate with a friend of mine over NFT  So today he asked me to accept a invite on a Disc server with the group name SolKongz. Of course I rejected because as far as I know for me NFT is a currency so I categorize it as a Crypto Currency. That's when I told him that if he wanted something to invest on or at least spend his time would be a higher currency or something with more value than that. He told me ""I didnt ask you to read about it I just want you to follow it. Because in your opinion you might think that they will abolish it"". That's when I started explaining to him about the blockchain and that I believe that the chain might corrupt or anything like that and I think he got pissed or something like that but anyways  My questions are :  First : Do you approve joining disc servers out of the blue  and have them make your invite people so you will be verified or promoted to a higher rank  Second : From a rate 1-10 how worth is it investing on NFT?  Third : Do NFTs have scammers or anything that might harm you or any danger that is unknown to people that are you to NFT?",0.7146,0.057,0.833,0.11

If it costs $50 (for example) to mint one item, why do we have to pay $100 if we are minting them at the same time?  After all, we are making a single transaction not multiple, so why the split?

You need a minimally viable product to attract the first investment, and it's estimated to cost a few million rubles.

Finally, let's make a hypothetical:                    Cruise lines and airplanes are both very carbon intensive industries and may or may not be sub-placed by electric aviation vehicles or electric aquatic vehicles. But if they both ceased to exist, the carbon footprint of the fossil fuel industry wouldn't disappear overnight, so there aren't absolute swarms of protestors trying to shut down these two industries.                  And last but not least, renewables are often the cheapest form of electricity because societies and governments tend to give financial leniancy in the form of tax credits / carbon credits to enterprises that use these forms of energy.",0.7469,0.023,0.921,0.055

"&lt;TL;DR&gt;  1. NFT games are plagued by obscurity in every sense of the word. Getting away without reading the whole whitepaper is almost impossible and even then you don't get it all 2. NFT in game assets have artificially inflated prices whose purposes is to inflate the creator's pockets before they bail out.    An imagined NFT gun may cost more than a real gun while not providing 1% of the real thing's value, which violates a basic law of economics: stuff costs what it is worth.    Then the game flops and you're on your own  &lt;/TL;DR&gt;    Putting aside the fact that I never got why or how we got to the point of selling monkey pictures for millions of dollars, I do acknowledge NFTs will/can be great in gaming.  However, since I got hooked onto this I feel that NFT games in general have two serious problems:  1. **Information about NFT games is often obscure:**   idk why but NFT games are damned by this.    Finding information about or related to the game is often hard, and you either read the whitepaper or you'll hardly get what's going on.   S  2. **Main problem: most NFT lack a sustainable economic model, they're pyramid schemes and their tokens provide little or no actual value at all.**  Traditional games sell stuff for cash, and that's okay.  A better gun, sword or nicer looking skin costs a couple $$, you pay for it, kill more and gets satisfied. The rarer or better the asset, the more it costs.   The most important aspect here is that ***in a traditional gaming model, assets cost a reasonable price for what they're worth and anyone willing to pay gets them.***  Now, that's not how NFT's been working: to have a gun at all, you'll pay $2000 dollars. To be able to monetize, you'll need 3 such guns.  Then the game *might not even have enough population* to provide fun or be playable at a sustainable rate, **meaning there's no real value provided by these assets that corresponds to the price paid.** Often, there's no value at all..  The game flops, the token crashes, and the creators cash in whatever you paid for their empty promises. Thus, the model's unsustainability shows itself.  In short, NFT games seem to violate important principles of economics, namely, that an asset's price somehow corresponds to the value it provides to its buyer. Besides that, the final price will incorporate production costs. NFT's don't match real objects in either case, but still cost unrealistically more.",0.7656,0.12,0.754,0.126

"Suppose I  want to sell a collection of 10k items, like bayc, cryptopunks etc. you all must be familiar with.   I have generated the images and linked my metamask wallet to opensea. I want to mint it on the Ethereum Blockchain, so I assume I would first have to pay a one time wallet initialization fee.   What are the charges after that ?   I presume there's a gas fees for listing each item, but I don't think all these collections with numerous items pay so much in gas fees, right? I heard of lazy minting but can't figure it out for opensea, also it follows ERC-1155 , while most of these collections are ERC-721.  How do they achieve that ?  As per my knowledge, the initial minting costs for most NFTs (usually 0.08) is to cover the gas fees, which comes into action after the sale has executed (due to lazy minting). Am I wrong?  I just want to know the step involved, and investment/cost of entry if I decide to pursue this kind of a collection drop.

Do you think NFTs is a place to everything or only things that will actually have some value to humanity, bringing a discussion in the fields of art, history and Philosophy?",0.7717,0.0,0.922,0.078

Wondering if there are any sites or browser extensions that factor in the price of eth at time of purchase and create an adjusted price history for opensea NFTs. So instead of seeing that something sold for 1 eth 3 years ago it shows the real dollar value at the time of how much they paid. The price charts would be FAR more useful. As far as I’m concerned the default opensea price history is useless. Obviously this is not in the best interest of opensea or sellers but it would greatly benefit the buyers,0.7719,0.04,0.844,0.116

"Hey newbie question, have been learning about using NFTs for access to virtual/physical spaces and products. I’m having trouble understanding how secondary purchases that come with a physical product guarantee payment through blockchain.  Say I’m an author and I sell an NFT. With that purchase, you will be given a physical copy of my book.   You read the book and then decide to sell the physical copy to someone non digitally. With that being irl, does that completely forgo any royalty to me as the creator of the NFT? Also, the 2nd buyer of the book may not even be aware that there is an NFT for it.   I’d imagine there are legalities surrounding protection of the creator of the NFT but I’d love for someone to dumb it down for me. Thanks!!!",0.7735,0.044,0.872,0.084

"I'm thinking about doing a 1k\~10k project. I don't know if I'll be an artist, a founder, or both.  I received all proposals suggested by the different %. Therefore, I would like to know the approximate %. I think the artist is the one who has to carry the most money.   I don't think it's right for a founder to get more than an artist unless he pays for all the additional human resources besides developers and moderators. (If the founder has completed all the projects in a fantastic way, I think it's right to take a lot.)   In my opinion, the proportion that each person has to carry is 30% artist, 15\~17%  development, 20% moderator, 25% founder, 10% reinvestment.  but I can't figure it out.

"Hello, I have been learning more about NFTs recently and I'd like some clarification on how the property of uniqueness is defined and enforced.  So my understanding so far is that what is actually encoded on the blockchain is something like this:      {       ""link"": ""imgur.com/watermelon_smash.gif"",       ""artist"": ""Gallagher"",       ""year"": 2021     }  And there will be some other metadata as well, but it's all just metadata. The image is hosted somewhere else, often IPFS, but it could be anywhere.     So, let's say Gallagher himself mints an NFT with the above metadata. Once it is on the blockchain it has a unique token ID (let's assume this is on Ethereum for now). Everybody knows that token ID is unique, and no other token will be mixed up with it.     However, is there any mechanism stopping somebody from minting another NFT with the exact same metadata? I understand it would have a different resulting token ID, but other than that it would be indistinguishable, right?  Is there a mechanism for resolving which one is legitimate? Is there another chain that has stronger guarantees?",0.797,0.026,0.904,0.07

Are they meant to be art that you purely sell at some point in time? What if you purchase an NFT from an unknown artist?  In my view, art is an investment that you display in your home. You take the time to view it as you pass by, appreciating the efforts of the artist. How do you do this with an NFT? We own several pieces of original art by artists who have a moderate following.

A focus of the investigation is to determine whether certain NFTs are being used to raise funds like traditional securities, the people said. Over the past few months, attorneys for the SEC’s enforcement division have issued subpoenas for information about the token offering. The investigation is the latest attempt by SEC Chairman Gensler to ensure crypto markets comply with his regulations.

How exactly is the artwork itself connected to the “NFT of the artwork”?  The NFT is basically data on the blockchain.  Does this NFT data somehow “encode” the artwork it stands for?  What makes me “own” an NFT?  Is ownership of an NFT technically comparable to ownership of a Bitcoin?  Do I “own” an NFT if the blockchain contains an unspent transaction for which I have the private key to the receiving address (like it is in the case of Bitcoin)?  How does (technically) an NFT come on the blockchain initially?  With Bitcoin it’s the “coinbase transaction” to the miner of the block” - what sort of blockchain entry stands for a newly created NFT?  Are NFTs transferred between addresses in the same way as coins?  Many thanks to the experts for helping me to understand the concept!,0.8101,0.0,0.94,0.06

I can’t seem to find value in an art piece done by a computer, which is to be then sold by a human for profit. From what I understand in AI Generated Art you input some text fields regarding what is to be the influence for the art piece it’s self. Then from all the knowledge a database has on said influences it creates an image. I see no value in this, and can’t understand paying a human for doing this. Because, painting is a skill, and if you ask 100 artists to paint the same scene or image, they will be some what different, depending upon medium, brush sizes, stroke directions, color usage. There will be 100 variations, as there’s 100 painters. But, and correct me if I’m wrong, if anyone of those painters was to I enter the same text fields into the AI Art software, it would create the same image no matter who entered the info?

"Greetings to everyone, please forgive my English.  For months I've been narrowing a project idea but I got stuck in a problem which I couldn't find a resolution in my online research on NFT capabilities.  I'm not comfortable yet to give details about my idea (because it might be worthless) so I will describe the problem in simple terms:    Let's suppose I'm Leonardo da Vinci and just painted and minted the Monalisa.  Now, properly minted and unique forever on blockchain, I sell it to Mr. X.  Mr. X now owns my ""Monalisa"", but I don't want him just to own it, but also to participate on it.  So this ""feature"" would allow (let's supposed) to Mr. X add to My 'Monalisa' NFT an additional data, let's say plain text.   So, as the owner Mr. X, adds plain text: ""This looks cool, my first NFT"" but his data do not change the image of Monalisa. It's just an ""add-on"".  Ok, so my Monalisa NFT image is intact, but now have a extra data from the buyer which is his whatever-he-wants-to-add-txt.  Mr. X then gets bored of my Monalisa and sells it to Mrs. Y.   Mrs. Y gets the untouched JPG original Monalisa and also can view the add-on ""plain text"" from the previous buyer. Mrs. Y is a bit controversial and Adds another data to the NFT. She puts: ""this NFT sucks, selling ASAP"".   So the issue is:  I understand that once into blockchain it can't be changed. Is there any possibility to this while maintaining the authenticity of the NFT using (metafeatures?) but to permit it's owners to add additional information to it without altering the original? Maybe with more cost, or maybe with a substitution of the first minted (my original Monalisa) with this new Monalisa with 2 additional data from buyers?    Sorry for my english, I hope you understand the issue.  Thanks is advance.",0.8153,0.072,0.83,0.098

I’m on a generative nft proj team and I wanted to get an idea on how others are structuring the equity split amongst the team. Currently we have a lot of people on the team since and suggestions that only 3 months of royalties will be given and also the initial season 1 team won’t get any earnings if they aren’t in season 2. Curious if other teams typically do full equity splits as per usual startups or if there are any special terms. Does the whole team own portions of equity or are the earnings just shared for a certain time for that specific launch and the founder owns the whole project?,0.8176,0.0,0.916,0.084

As they widen  their banks, they also fashion the sad urn of their burial.   Filled are the bowels of the earth with pestilential dust once flesh and bone,   once animate bodies of men who sat upon thrones, decided cases, presided in council,   commanded armies, conquered provinces, possessed treasure,  destroyed temples,   exulted in their pride, majesty, fortune, praise and power.   Vanished are these glories, just as the fearful smoke vanishes that belches forth from the infernal fires of Popocatepetl. Nothing recalls  them but the painted page.      &gt;   &gt;Do we really live on earth? We are not on earth forever, we are only here for a little while.   We are mortal, our mortality defines us. We have to die, we all have to go away, all of us.   Like a painting, we gradually fade.  \- Nezahualcoyotl (15th Century Acolhua ruler from Texcoco, central  Mexico)  Mictlán is the underworld in the traditional Nahua cosmology, in the  bowels of Cipactli, the primordial crocodile and earth monster.",0.8288,0.079,0.817,0.105

"  Follow text just shows some examples how NFTs could be useful in the future, especially for companies.   **Copyrights** When a graphic designer, designs something for a customer, such as logos, icons or fonts, then the customer can use them, but does not automatically own the rights to them. Instead of having to contractually negotiate the transfer of rights, this could be regulated via NFT. Things like icons or fonts in particular can often be reused. If another company shows interest in the icons, they could obtain the rights to them via an NFT purchase. The same would work for stock photos.  **Transfer of Ownership** There is a market for domain names since a long time. Domain names are bought in the hope they could sell it later for a high price to someone else. A frequent problem with this is that it is often difficult to reach the owner and negotiation can be difficult. Domains could therefore easily be auctioned via NFT.  **Trademark licensing** If a company like Lego wants to produce Star Wars sets, they have to get a license from the rights holder. With NFTs, licensing could be easier and the value of a brand like Star Wars can be seen in the NFT market.",0.8294,0.085,0.784,0.131

The Metaverse is a thing that's receiving a lot of push now, so I want to help make it a great experience by adding a bit of my style to the architecture! Over the Last year and a half I focused mainly on art and animations but now I'm adding 3D sculptures and architecture to the equation!   These sculptures are from my Stone &amp; Ore collection on Foundation. Aries was my first and Atlas is my newest! The idea is for whoever collects them to have them on display in a large format so they can be apart of the pedestrian skyline!

Also looking above the Minted record - I see it was transferred once to an account, and then listed. So this means that one account holds this item already, while the other ones are listed for sale? Additionally this means that the rest of the 100 that are minted, are yet not transferred or listed?     I tried avoiding calling these items copies or replicas, but doesn't the above imply this is the case indeed?     I hope this is the right place to ask",0.8321,0.028,0.905,0.067
"Hi guys. I am a noob in this Web3.0 world, and I would like to understand a bit more about it.  Since the NFT trend started, I've been always asking myself how can I see the NTF in the blockchain.   Platforms like Opensea provide links to etherscan.io, which is ok, but if I open the transaction I see nothing but numbers and hashes. Where is my (or reference to the) NFT?  Is it the hash of an image? A link to a website? If so, where can I see it on etherscan? Is it even there?  Thanks a lot",0.8321,0.012,0.883,0.105

"This is a very different NFT project  For this project, we wanted to create art with concepts that we had not yet seen in the NFT space and which also correlated to the vision of the project.  We chose a variety of crystals and gemstones and turned them into skins and also created skins from other species of animals.  We also wanted to promote global unity and diversity inclusion and to showcase this we chose to use the flags of over 30 countries on the Rhino horns and also selected many ethnic attires from around the world from both modern and ancient civilizations.

The flags are that the moderators aren't doxxed, for a 50K+ channel there's only \~20K verified, people getting banned because they're trying to find more info on the creators etc.   Seen a few posts warning people that this is potentially the next Cyclops Monkey Club so just wanted to gather some thoughts people had on the project as I thought their roadmap seemed pretty cool.

"Hello guys, I recently found out about this thing on Open Sea which is called “Alpha Mining Society” but I am not sure about how trustable it is. The concept of it is to buy an “NFT” which is indirectly a GPU of a miner. For this investment you get Weekly the money as return for your investment, so the idea of this concept is that you buy a GPU for a miner, and then he can mine ETH with it. For example, when you buy an “AMS VENT 16gb” for $200 on the site you'll receive Weekly $60 which is Monthly $240, therefore your investment is in one month again returned and from then on you just make profit. But I am questioning if this is even worth for the miner to give you this amount back for your 1 time investment.

"NFT art is just scratching the surface because NFTs are much more than just jpegs. They are rights to ownership. Having tokens that have their uniqueness guaranteed through blockchain opens many possibilities.    When NFTs expanded to the music industry as NFT Tickets it was expected that it would provide a special experience for the artist and fans in the digital world. NFT tickets can’t be destroyed and with their unique nature they can be easily showcased and shared with others on the internet. It also solved the problem of transparency as it is recorded in the blockchain. People in the secondary market can no longer rip off fans with a fake ticket and enable fair distribution of tickets.  NFTs can also give artists a new voice and help them connect with their fan communities. To implement this, we can choose from the different platforms like [Centaurify](http://www.centaurify.com/?r=1), [Get Protocol ](https://www.get-protocol.io/)or [Seatlab](https://seatlabnft.com/) for ticket minting and market functions.   NFTs have now become a market-expanding technology. Even the entrepreneurs started to envision a future where every ticket is an NFT. For example, the Dallas Mavericks, owned by [Mark Cuban](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-mark-cuban-wants-turn-151934328.html), decided to issue 20,000 NFTs for every home game. Fans were allowed to trade their NFTs, with sales ranging from $200 to $10,000. Also the Monumental Sports and Entertainment CEO - [Ted Leonsis](https://www.sportico.com/business/tech/2021/ted-leonsis-blockchain-ticketing-1234624872/) sees a blockchain future in ticketing.

"Music NFTs have been building for a long time, over a year ago there was almost nobody talking about the Web3 music revolution compared to today. We havent seen one particular model take off for music yet, like we've seen with pfps for example, but Music NFTs are here and they are working extremely well for the artists and collectors that are getting involved now.  We are still at the pioneer stage for music NFTs, but these assets have the potential to bring the value back to music and create billions of dollars of value on top of the current music industry. Artists have long been struggling for a more sustainable source of revenue, because the prevalent problem with streaming sites is that the majority of artist make little to no income from their music under the ""pay per stream"" model.

" We are a small group of crypto enthusiasts that started this new NFT project idea in order to bring the real-life cards into the digital world. We believe that NFT is not just a jpeg, it's a medium, a concept, a worldwide community of digital collectors. The success of NFT depends on its community. Cards are a part of our daily lives, thus we wanted to transfer that into the crypto space by generating these crypto card NFTs that are basically digital assets on the blockchain with unique metadata and ownership by whoever collects these cards. No NFT project has covered this type or card collectibles, is one of a kind and his collection lies in the fact that it is providing crypto projects printed in our NFT cards. The main goal is to generate as much crypto cards as possible for every collector to cover one of his favorite crypto tokens, thus every new upcoming crypto token/crypto game will fusion into one of these crypto cards and we will keep generating more NFT cards as we speak.

"Selling digital art on the internet is now possible, thanks to NFT. This form of virtual currency is currently exploding and generating millions of dollars in the international market. Find out more about this new cryptocurrency trend in this article.    The development of digital technology has generated many financial opportunities in the world. The best known of them is cryptocurrency, which allows the accumulation and transaction of “virtual currency”. The latter is recorded in a virtual ledger called “blockchain”. But besides virtual currency, did you know that you can also buy and sell virtual art? Thanks to the blockchain, many “web artists” put images, GIFs, or videos for sale on the internet through a process called NFT. And as absurd as it may sound, it pays a lot! But what is NFT? How does it really work? And how to make money with it? In this article, we’ll dive into this revolutionary and controversial investment trend.

"I am still seeing a few drops that use dutch auctions and it makes me wonder why.    I feel like I am missing something in my understanding of the dutch auctions and wanted to get your point of view.      I heard several times that drops like VeeFriends used this model to prevent gas wars, and I get that last year we didn't have too many other options.    But right now, there are several new ERC standards as well as L2 scaling solutions, and I wonder if there is any other argument, artists and companies support, that make them choose the dutch auction type of NFT sale.      I can see how dutch auctions can work as a ""revenue maximalisation""tool. If you pick the ""fixed price"" option - you don't really know if people would actually be willing to pay more for your NFT or not.    With the dutch auction, people themselves choose their price.  The problem I see however is that if your starting price is widely off, compared to the value you created around your NFTs, people will be waiting and waiting until they finally pull the trigger.      That may sound as an ""okay"" way of doing things, however aren't they missing out on potential publicity? It seems better to have dozens of news portals creating articles saying (for example) that your campaign sold out in less than 1 hour etc. vs days or weeks.         https://preview.redd.it/kxo8cvcv96k81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6bdc6c2a93995c0a392c511981f10873a94348b4",0.8523,0.061,0.837,0.102

Does this mean I can play the game with a slower computer because most of the computation takes place on the chain? Will I need a  high speed internet connection?

Whatever I choose, I have to make it sound like there's steady employment waiting for me, because that's the goal of this VA program. I haven't come up with a way to show this with illustration.

"I recently stumbled upon a great NFT project recently which in my personal opinion is one of the most unique projects i'v seen in a very long time. Considering the level of copycat projects similar to BAYC and or the Crypto Punks.  It is refreshing to see a whole new concept with a face behind the Project. When i say face, i mean the brain behind the project a little know software engineer and blockchain expert by the name of Aleksandr Levcenko. In the modern age where NFT is being adopted i personally think its important to see the face and or faces behind a project as this does give investors peace of mind to prevent the many known scams and rug pulls in the Crypto and NFT space altogether.  The project i am referring to is the Bored Weird Vitalik Club (BWVC). It's so weird and unusual even the father; of the father of Crypto Giant Ethereum (Vitalik Buterin) tweeted about it.

On Thursday afternoon, Twitter announced that it would be rolling out iOS support for nonfungible token, or[ NFT development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/non-fungible-token-development), hexagonal avatars. As of now, only paid subscribers of Twitter Blue using iOS, which costs $2.99 per month, can access the feature. According to a tutorial video, users can connect their wallet, including Coinbase Wallet, Rainbow, MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Argent, or Ledger Live, and set it as their profile pic, with the process taking a few seconds.  Users can also learn more about each other's NFT avatars, such as their owners, creators, description of the series, as well as verification of authenticity on third-party platforms like OpenSea. According to Twitter, the platform does not maintain an ongoing connection with one's crypto wallet. However, the firm stores one's the public wallet address to ensure that it continues to hold the NFT avatar. Although one can only set it on iOS through Twitter Blue, the NFT profile pic will be visible across all platforms.  The functionality of the development is still in the early stages. Twitter currently supports only static images, such as JEPG and PNG files, minted on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, including ERC-721 and ERC-1155 token standards. But if one sells or transfers the NFT while still set as a profile picture, it will not display any information regarding its ownership when clicked.  But any over-enthusiasm would be short-lived. According to Twitter users and blockchain enthusiasts, the feature appears to work for any NFT in one’s collection— not just those in verified collections.

He would often keep the original photos as companies would not request the photos back once they had their service completed.

"By now most people know that one of the most powerful things about NFT's is that they are digital items that behave like they are physical.  What less people realize is the other side of that equation: Physical items that behave as if they are digital.  Let me illustrate...     **Turing Completenes**  NFT's are universally programable via smart contracts.  Whatever functionality you can program into a normal app, NFT's can do in principle.  This universality allow NFT shape shift into many things simultaneously not just one thing at a a time.     **Combinatory**  Each individual NFT can be combined with other NFTs to create a complete picture and unlock all sorts of features/rewards.  Imagine you have to collect or pool (via DAO) 20 NFTs to turn them into a clue for the next airdrop.     **Transmorphability**  NFTs can be programmed with emergent functionality.  Imagine a collection of generative artworks that looks and behave one way individually but when you own 5 of them changes into something completely different. (Think Megazord from Power Rangers )     **Daisy Chaining**  NFT's can have conditions built which have to be met to unlock access to other NFT's.  This allow you to create anything from murder mysteries, to treasure hunts, to level creation (Scientologists rejoice) and any progressive certification fully automated.     **Derivative**  u/lootproject showed us that you can even turn everything on its head by providing abstract idea NFT's (called loot backs) and then have a community build a whole universe around them using derivatives called synthetic Loot as the incentive structure.  We haven't even begun to scratch the surface of what is possible.  Only imagination, experiments and the law of computation sets the limits for what is possible.

"Although the restaurant will not officially open its doors until 2023, two types of subscriptions in Ether are already for sale.  VCR Group, the hospitality company founded by entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk, has announced the sale of tokens from its latest private dining club for members in New York City, called the Flyfish Club. Prospective seafood diners must purchase their membership on the blockchain, sold as a non-fungible token (NFT).  Flyfish Club (FFC) is the world's first private dining club for members, where membership is purchased on the blockchain as a [non-fungible token (NFT](https://www.blockchainx.tech/non-fungible-token-development)) and owned by the token holder to gain access to our restaurant's already diverse culinary, cultural and social experiences.  VCR Group answered the question ""Why NFT?"" on the Flyfish Club website, stating:  ""By using NFTs, the FFC is able to create a community of loyal members to whom we can offer special experiences. The [development of NFTs](https://www.blockchainx.tech/non-fungible-token-development) creates new modernist financial models, which will allow the FFC to offer an exceptional and sustainable product for years to come.""   It seems that there are two types of membership available on the official website. The normal tier claims to give members access to the main dining room, outdoor space, and cocktail lounge, as well as special events, for 2.5 Ether ( ETH ), or $8,474 at the time of writing. The second, more expensive tier, Flyfish Omakase, will give access to all of the above and a 14-seat omakase room, and is available now for 4.25 ETH or $14,400.  According to their website, Flyfish Membership NFT holders can rent their token to non-token holders on a monthly basis, or they can resell it. There are also no recurring annual fees. And even though cryptocurrency is required to purchase membership, customers can pay for their food and drinks in US dollars.  Flyfish Club is VCR Group's second concept, following the opening of omakase-style Japanese restaurant Ito, which is also located in New York City but is not exclusive to members. Flyfish Club is scheduled to open in early 2023.  Flyfish Club claims to be NFT's first members-only restaurant; however, it is not the first culinary concept to integrate cryptocurrencies into its business model. Most recently, the Crypto Street Restaurant opened in Clearwater, Florida, featuring crypto-themed wall art, menu items, and accepting cryptocurrency payments.",0.8777,0.011,0.944,0.045

And lets say I sold 30k worth of NFT's of my own creation (via OS or Rarible) in 2021. Does this mean that for the 30k worth of nft's sold, that is part is taxed via ""self employment"" which is a 15% tax rate.

"Larva Labs shocked the NFT world yesterday afternoon when it announced that it would sell the IP for the popular CryptoPunks project to Yuga Labs, creators of the Bored Ape Yacht Club. And after the news broke, CryptoPunks started selling like hotcakes.  According to data from CryptoSlam, secondary market sales of the Ethereum NFT collection have totaled $18.8 million over the last 24 hours, marking a 1,219% increase over the previous 24-hour span.  New buyers may be expecting additional value for the CryptoPunks project now that it will be under the command of Yuga Labs, which turned the Bored Ape Yacht Club into a sales juggernaut and celebrity favorite in less than a year.  Yuga Labs announced that it will grant IP rights for individual CryptoPunks images to their respective holders, much as it has for its own Bored Ape collections. That detail had been a point of contention for some CryptoPunks owners in the past, as Larva Labs had previously given unclear guidance about holders’ ability to monetize their NFT images.  In addition to surging sales volume, the floor price—or the cheapest available NFT in the project listed on a marketplace—for CryptoPunks has risen 11% during the span, to a current price of over 75 ETH (about $195,000).  This news is urging me to look for a potentially profitable NFT project to get involved in, so that in the future I can flip an NFT for a lot more on OpenSea, Mintable, Deedly Digital or LooksRare.",0.8779,0.052,0.858,0.09

"Hi guys! Today I want to discuss with you one of the most debated use cases for NFTs that everyone is saying can increase the adoption rate and it is not an overpriced jpg with a monkey.  Digital certifications are an important topic nowadays, that can be used to test the authenticity of a product, or event and create tight bonds between humans.  A **college graduation diploma** attests that you followed the courses of that university and you also had all the necessary grades to pass. An **artwork certification paper** attests that the product in place is the original one and not a copy built on a Chinese vessel in 2 days. All of these examples have the sole purpose of increasing the trust among people and reducing the fraud numbers.  But, the above two examples have quite a big problem. The difference between a college diploma and a certification for artwork is their ability to be traded. You don't have the interest and no one has, to sell your 4 years worked college graduation paper because from that moment the new owner can prove that he has the experience written on that certificate, ... which is FALSE. However, you would want to exchange the authenticity certification of an artwork cause it has no ties with you personally. Another difference would be the number of ""NFTs"" that can be created. A rare collection of art pieces is limited and unique, but college diplomas are created every year due to new generations that are graduating.  I want to start a debate about this topic, and see how we can shape those beautiful ""smart contracts"" so we can create NFTs for each use case.",0.8794,0.059,0.828,0.113

Today only two large collections (with about 10k items) have a floor price near or above 100 ETH: BAYC and Cryptopunks.

Once we have filled the quota, we will open PS and give the WLd people a period of time to mint their NFT. The NFT they receive will essentially be a placeholder for the final piece of artwork.

Once we’ve had a chance to turn around the personalised artworks, we want to deliver this to the recipient. We’re thinking the best way to do this is by airdropping the final piece.

I have some traits that are too big for certain traits.  For example a big hat trait that covers some big eye traits.   Is there any way I can generate multiple times using certain combinations that DO fit together and then gather the metadata json files into 1?   Or is there a way to block certain traits from pairing with certain traits?   Please send me some generators that can do either of these things.   Thank you in advance!,0.8873,0.034,0.774,0.192

"Firstly, I'm not a nay-sayer. I'm a software engineer &amp; systems architect trying to get his head around why I would want an NFT system of value proof over a centralised database.  Crypto and NFTs are super clever tech, but try as I might, I can't see how they can be applied to real world objects and assets in a way that preserves the decentralisation.  For example: I've seen several people tout NFTs as a way to replace property deeds as proof of ownership. Sounds cool and would be very secure but there's a big catch: What happens when someone loses their private key?  If you lose your bitcoin key, tough shit. Lose your imaginary value tokens and the remaining ones become more scarce. No problem. Not true if those tokens represent ownership of real objects or assets like land. You would need some central governing body to prove you are the owner by some other means and then allocate some new token for that asset. At which point, why not just have a centralised database?  My best guess is that NFTs and crypto tokens will only ever be truly useful for representing digital assets and rights where if you lose your keys it's ok for the answer to be ""Sucks to be you"". Stuff like lottery tickets, digital media rights or digital collectibles &amp; metaverse assets.  Am I missing something?",0.8877,0.137,0.679,0.185

People simply focus on JPEGs and status symbols and that’s it when in reality NFTs have a lot more utility.  This utility is especially shown in the services sector where some people often rent out their NFTs for other people to use for a certain amount of time especially if the NFT is like one of those Last Hopium NFTs that offer exclusive access to important places and contacts that a person would benefit from.  Its kinda frustrating that this isn’t being focused on as much as the “status symbol” side of NFTs.

" I found a collection where each NFT is a minute of one day, and each minute is a location in the game.   Each location gets a share of the players purchases. I really liked the concept.   I made three tables where I sorted all the collection items by different characteristics.   The links are in the comments.     The collection website says that items can be grouped together, i.e. 60 minutes can be grouped into an hour. If you do this, the reward is doubled.    * **Cooperation.** Negotiate with other NFT owners, combine minutes into an hour and get double the profits. * **Egoism (greenmail).** Buy one minute per hour and not agree to join with other players, forcing them to buy my NFTs at a much higher price.

"Hi,  I'm making a cartoon-ish character for (hopefully) selling it as a NFT, its an alien character and I have planned to make lots of animations for it. Is the art supposed to be unique? I mean if I put/upload a GIF for *one* of its animation sequences and someone buys it, then does it mean that I cannot upload other animations of the same character as a separate NFT?  Suppose I want to sell all animation GIFs as a single asset, but the GIFs will have to be separate or else it will be a single GIF containing all the animation sequences back to back (which doesn't make any sense to me)   1. can i upload more than one GIFs as a a single NFT? or, 2. can I make an application HTML5/ Windows x64 EXE (to allow buyer to play animations) as a single NFT?

I do not claim superior skill, I just love making unique images and hope to start a side hustle with it.  But, after I made my first NFT (on Rarible) and I began brainstorming of how to promote it's existence to the NFT-buying public I realized that most NFT collectors are not discerning. Clearly. It follows that marketing my NFT to the current marketplace is probably not going to work.  Obviously we're in the early stages of the existence of the NFT market so maybe it might be a bit like in the beginning of human existence on earth when early humans were only capable of drawing on cave walls. They had the technology of their drawing tools but the art part of it sucks. It's only value lies in that it came first.  I would guess most legit artists are not experts in selling NFTs.

"It's simple: If you make a non-digital artwork, every artwork will be unique, because it's analog. But if you make your artwork digital, it's impossible to make it unique because it is digital  and not analog. You could make exact copies of it that will be indiscernible to the original. On the other hand you can't make an exact copy of your analog artwork. It doesn't matter how hard you try, it will never be the exact same artwork.  So how could you give your digital artwork something that would make it unique? There comes NFT into play.   The difference is: you can directly own an analog artwork, because of its unique nature, but you can't own a digital artwork but you can own an NFT of the artwork instead.",0.893,0.008,0.905,0.087

"""   Let’s face it, most people in the NFT market literally have no clue what they’re doing. They just think it’s a place where you can go in, gamble high, make big bucks and make a clean exit. Well sorry to disappoint ya, but if you ask the average NFT FOMOer, you’ll find it clear that’s not how this works.   You’ll find it hard to succeed in a scheme when the whole world is pulling the same scheme… Literally, everyone I know is trying to make for it in the NFT market, selling and buying random crap until they hit triple cherries, and very few have succeeded. Why is that? Because their tactic of throwing salt is horrible.   You have to know what you are doing here, especially when you’re in the same type of car racing against every other person in the world. You need an edge.   The edge comes, personally speaking here, with NFTs that break the mold. JPEGs that offer more than just an image. Take the Royal Falcons Club for example, they have a unique usage of NFTs, as their different 5050 editions offer different rewards. That, for once offers something more.   Other NFTs, are being used for charity. Such as the Pope’s carpet sold. Those ones are making it big too.""",0.8933,0.061,0.84,0.098

"I learned about NFTs recently and I was thinking for a while about what I would do if I was making an NFT collection.   And today it actually struck me.

I have ideas for hundreds of pieces and every one of them with his own individuality.  It's not avatars or algorithm-generated art. I think that people probably thought of it but there are no NFTs of it or even something similar online.  But the problem is... it's just me, myself, and I. That's fine. I know exactly what to do till one part of it... promoting it.  I can't risk putting my idea in the wild before I even start working on it. Somebody with more resources can snatch it and make it his own. I can't do it even if I've already had something to show because again somebody with more resources can just snatch it. The only thing that I can do is to polish it and just post it and hope that the people will like it. And again if it doesn't have much traction and eventually dies off.

"   Recently, I saw an article regarding StockX and their new NFT announcement and I thought that I would make a post on it because I truly believe that there is a major opportunity behind their announcement.  For those of you who don't know, StockX is a resale platform for high-end products including mostly shoes, however, they have recently begun to move into the NFT space which allows for people who speculate on these kinds of things to not have to worry about the many slow-downs involved with their usual business (some of these slow-downs might include shipping and authentication of the product). This is when NFTs come in. Not only do they allow for instant transactions of these shoes that people speculate on such that flip times are much faster, but there is also no extra cost of shipping and authentication which saves lots of money.  I believe that there is a new opportunity emerging and I just wanted to let more people know about it.

Here's a small sample of my work... really would love to know your thoughts :)  My first collection is on Opensea and is called the canadian outdoors: [https://opensea.io/collection/the-canadian-outdoors](https://opensea.io/collection/the-canadian-outdoors)  https://preview.redd.it/omnpwl92li981.jpg?width=5184&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2012c4dd04ef84778fa1835d1a51edfdbb72074  https://preview.redd.it/p38wjda8li981.jpg?width=4371&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdd256841bb6a3413a1c91d2e766abde06f6aca3",0.8965,0.0,0.884,0.116

"Hello guys, I'm an artist and I've been asked by some people to work on an nfr project. They're gonna handle marketing, coding and basically anything that doesn't involve creating art, and we agreed on splitting the revenue in equal parts. How do I protect myself and get a guarantee that they will not run away with the money? One of them told me that they can set up a shared wallet, which as they said would need approvation from every team member for every transaction. Is this legit? How can I be sure that the money will be actually sent to that shared wallet and not another? What else can I do?",0.8973,0.016,0.858,0.125

Do creators buy their own art to create hype?  I don't understand how it's possible?  I don't think a little marketing can generate such a thing, it can't be so easy.

I would also like to offer a limited edition of signed and numbered prints (physical print on archival paper), which comes with an NFT that serves as a certificate of authenticity for each number in the edition.
