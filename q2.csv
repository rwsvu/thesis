"    Hey everyone, hope all is good.  I was wondering if anyone else was having an issue with Instagram disabling their promo account(s) for no reason what so ever?   I have been trying to use Instagram to build a following for my upcoming drop and it has been nothing but hassle.  My first account I had listed as a “creator account” and it got disabled, no big deal, I made another and just left it as a personal account.  My 2nd account, I start to get a moderate following with users and other creators sharing my posts to their stories and pages, then one day out of the blue, disabled with the “24 hour review” page appearing, I provided my info and I think it was a lost cause because it appears my account just ceased to exist, I had not been spamming follows to other accounts or spamming peoples inboxes as some other accounts do.   I’m on my third account now, its set as personal but honestly I am disheartened. It does look bad as a creator to keep getting disabled and reappearing, especially after gaining a good following the 2nd time around.  This is incredibly frustrating as obvious spam accounts and bots appear to be untouched but myself as a legit creator who is just trying to gain a following before a drop keeps getting kicked to the curb.",0.3899,0.119,0.759,0.122

" Mad Mongoose is doing a token offering at an initial price of 0.01 USD / token, with the intention of raising a minimum of 100m USD for direct investment in the fund. Supply is capped at 10bn tokens.  This provides an excellent opportunity to invest in both crypto and equities, while having the backing of real assets for the token (the Mad Mongoose LLC fund). This is known as an asset backed token. All new subscriptions will be fully invested in the fund. As subscriptions increase, so too will the underlying value of the token, providing stability for the token.  As hedge funds traditionally have strict lockup periods, the use of the Mad Mongoose token provides instant liquidity for holders of the Mad Mongoose Fund. It also overcomes the high minimum investment requirements. This means that an investment traditionally only open to high net worth individuals is now available to anyone.

I've always made stuff - I guess you can call it art - like paintings, drawing shit and whatnot. Now that I can code and am dedicating most of my time to studying computer science, I decided to play around with GANs and CNNs (neural networks) that can take in a sentence and produce a visual interpretation of that based on google text data - so most of what people have thought/think. This is the result of the sentence ""**everything and nothing**"". The black hole in the middle mixed with the water, stars and weird cave-like painting of a buffalo makes it awesome in my opinion.

"So, last year, I bought a cheap lightly-used laptop off of Craigslist for school. Yeah, I know, a stupid idea, right? Save the nagging- I've heard the horror stories before.  In my defense, try living like an overworked, exhausted, and ~~obviously~~ broke student during a pandemic and tell me just how clear your mind is.   Anyways, we met at a local fast-food place &amp; the transaction went smoothly, if not disorientingly fast.   But I'm not here to brag. After using my laptop for a while- I can definitively say that something is *really* wrong.  An untitled file containing 1 picture keeps reappearing on my computer.  I've tried everything to get rid of the file and image, but it always reappears a few days later.  Before I hear the jokes, **yes**, I've turned my laptop on and off again, and still no luck.   Even though it hurt my pride, I found outside help to look at the system without telling them about my particular...situation. One can only look so crazy.   Each time I'm given the computer back, it's the same reply. Absolutely nothing is wrong with the computer itself.  I've also tried to find the original source of the image, but nothing pops up. Same with the seller. It's as if he disappeared off the face of the Earth (or at least the internet) after my purchase! Looking back on it now, I wish he had just screwed me over with the typical type of creepy story so that I could laugh about it openly with my friends.  The picture keeps coming back no matter what. I don't want to be in the custody of this thing forever, and I can't just ignore this situation. Each time I even *think* about the file**, BOOM**, instant migraine behind the eyes. And no, it's not just dry eyes from prolonged monitor use.   So I've been thinking. I need to use the web and give the image a true home &amp; owner that I definitely don't want to be.    If the image becomes an NFT and gets proper owner(s) through the blockchain, whatever keeps coming back to my laptop will (hopefully) detach itself from me.  I don't know if I'm selling a, IDK, like a *fucking curse in the making*. And quite frankly, I don't care. I just want relief.    Does that make me a shitty person?   I just wanted to know if I'm a bad person.  What if someone purchases it down the blockchain without knowledge of its effects? What if it spirals?  I wanted to warn people about what I'm thinking of doing. Please, help take this thing off my hands.   I'm not the original creator of the unnamed file and its content, but I find myself the unofficial holder as I weigh the options of finding the image a true owner (potentially using NFTs).",0.4122,0.128,0.74,0.132

"I've been making photos of that tree in 2012-2013 almost everyday intending to make a timelapse video (never happened). Its a poor quality mobile shots, low res even. Just trying to capture the life itself, fading and blooming, rich and fair.   It was such a different time and i couldn even imagine our life to be like this in 2022.  This is a post from Russia.  We are isolated, we are frightened, we are helpless. We are prisoners here. We are witnessing our country becoming world's biggest threat and we can do nothing to stop it. Our lifes now are nightmares getting closer every hour.   Peace is all we want.   So let this tree be a sign of peace that we all deserve. Piece of something bigger that everyone one can have and share in times of need. Sign of tranquil life that we all deserve.  Sign of good times that will come eventualy.   https://preview.redd.it/ydj84syq7rj81.jpg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52e97d631c131ef074afa4cea4519a69e97b0f02",0.4191,0.114,0.746,0.141

I work in Los Angeles and live in South Carolina. I've always had a fascination with random anonymous photos and started taking these snapshots of random old &amp; new photos from a vendor at the Melrose Trading post in LA. There are about 250 of these types of photos that I have and this is the first I've turned into an NFT. The NFT series and other photography will be part of my upcoming photo book and website called PeoplePhotosdotcom.   I am posting the first here today because someone in my circles who also creates NFT's from photography said mine were stupid because I intentionally left my ugly thumb in the photo. I'd love some feedback on whether i am on the right path.,0.4215,0.052,0.874,0.074

If I buy the NFT of the letter, what can I do with it, e.g. display it exclusively on my website? Can I pursue others who display digital images of the letter, even if they predate the NFT creation.

" NFTs seem really cool. I'm a bit confused about something though. Please help me clarify my views on this:  * Owning an NFT is not in any way related to owning an IP * An NFT is part of a de-centralized ledger. The point of the ledger is to function as a de-centralized verification mechanism. * Nothing is stopping anyone from creating a new ledger where the exact same piece of art could be added as an NFT. * This means that the legitimacy of who owns the most authoritative NFT of a piece of art is a question of which ledger is the most ""legit"". This is basically a social contract and cannot be argued for or against in code or with math. * Which means that the only thing an NFT of a piece of art is good for, only thing you can do with it is exchange ownership of it for money. * Which means that the ledger are sort of like different cryptocurrencies and all the NFTs in them act as a ""coin"". This purchasing power or monetary value fluctuates between NFTs and between ledgers. The same meme is worth different amounts of money on different ledgers. * The real IP ownership is decided in the legal system, which operates completely independently of any blockchain.  It's like people are collecting stamps, but there's a multiverse of different planet earths where the exact same stamps are dispersed differently and with no relation to each other. This whole thing is really hard for me to wrap my head around.  Am I missing something obvious here?",0.448,0.036,0.891,0.074

"Traditional investments, such as stocks and bonds, are not the same as NFTs. As previously said, they possess unique characteristics and provide benefits that we are only beginning to grasp and appreciate. Ownership, however, is not without danger.     Just keep in mind that the risk profile of NFTs is distinct from that of other asset classes. As a result, by including NFTs into an investment portfolio, you may be able to increase its efficiency. Essentially, this entails establishing a better risk-to-reward ratio. Holding memecoins like Mononoke Inu or Doge in your portfolio, for example, in case their value skyrockets. You may make extra money by using NFTs from those memecoins or NFTs from other services. Of course, there is a danger of loss, but with proper risk management, a well-balanced portfolio may be achieved.

"Hi, I'm an artist looking to make some side money from my art. I've been an amateur artist for a bit now and I decided this week I wanted to start an NFT project, I'm not interested in learning how ETH works or whatever I just want to sell my art, so I made a few sprites and created my first set of tokens. I gotta admit making the sprites was a lot of fun and still is but it's very different from my usual work. I hoped this project would pave a path towards being able to make money out of my regular art. Any tips?   Ps. Here is my Twitter handle if anyone is interested  @berguziaNFT",0.4738,0.039,0.877,0.083

"Hey,  Just trying to wrap my head around some things, I am new to NFT. So on my collection properties, I have ""**Your payout wallet address**"" where I can put my wallet's address. I've added my metamask ETH address, as I understand it, metamask by default is connected to the Etherum mainnet.  Now I minted my NFT's on Polygon. When I hover over the price it says ETH on Polygon. So my questions are:  1. Does it mean that I have to provide a polygon wallet address instead of an ETH wallet address? 2. If my NFT is on Polygon can someone still pay me in ETH on the Ethereum network? So they get NFT over polygon and I get my ETH to my metamask on ETH mainnet? 3. Not sure how this works, I was under the impression that NFT is on Polygon and then ETH goes over the Ethereum network and not Polygon?  I am eager to learn, so I will also be happy to see any links to where I can dive deeper into this topic.",0.4745,0.032,0.93,0.038

"I'm curious, since I'm new to the NFT scene, is there a reason that people seem to be more into the digital art NFT's as opposed to the photography of real people, animals, places, etc? Is it because it's created and not something people can, theoretically, go out and see for themselves? I know some people have struck gold by selling pictures of themselves. But, outside of the one famous case that I've heard of, the majority of sellers seem to be the art portion. Am I completely off base and have no idea what I'm talking about or...?

I thought about that “money man” music video from the A$AP Mob and how hard they tried to make it look that movie “La Haine”. I thought to myself , since most members have got even more famous now (especially rocky , after the news about his relationship with Rihanna) they could do that again and place it as a unique item or something like that , it would probably work. Hell , I think even I could do something like that ( in a low level of production , of course). I could team up with some local artists that are most likely to become famous in the future and shoot this edited vlog looking thing with their featured music on and this could work as a documentation of the early days of one of these artists.  A scenario where all of them end up getting really famous and becoming renowned would be like hitting the jackpot , people would see that piece of media as the “Holy Grail” and it would only become more valuable as their career progresses. But anyways , that’s just me thinking , I have no idea of how this whole thing will work in the future. So I would like to know what you guys think.",0.4848,0.045,0.894,0.061

"Ive been into Crypto sometime now and started exploring NFT about a month ago. From what I understand 90% of projects/collections have no tangible value at all. From what I gathered it also seems that most of the $ traded in NFT are that of traders who are looking to flip a coin.   Projects like the CryptoPunks and bored-yacht do stand out, but most of the projects are just silly. There are even projects where the creator bluntly states he(she) didnt invest any effort to create them(nft\_is\_dead\_long\_live\_nft,  for example) and projects who are damn ugly(genesis-creepz for example).   For disclosure I bought one NFT(infinity frogs) for trying this, but now I think I miss my 50$ :)",0.4939,0.06,0.845,0.095

" For those who are unfamiliar with crypto, the concept of an NFT might be difficult to comprehend. They are, nevertheless, not difficult to comprehend or read.   An NFT is a one-of-a-kind bit of data that links its owner to a certain server or place on the internet. This URL can also be used to store a picture, a GIF, a music video, or anything else that is 'ART.'      The author of the original entity saved on the server is the one who decides if the collectibles change or what the full NFT bundle has to offer. If someone owns an NFT, they haven't truly purchased the creator's work. Instead, just the bragging rights were acquired, and the artist retains custody of the artwork, whatever it may be.     This piqued my interest, and I couldn't help but conduct further study into it all, which is how I came upon PhoenixDao.   They have this plan where you can swap your NFTs for tickets to all kinds of events through their dApp, and when I read that, I had to wonder whether we will be utilizing NFTs to go into various public events in the future.

The cards right now redirect to [Rarible.com](http://rarible.com/) to see more details about the item and maybe complete the purchase there, while the idea was to allow users to complete the purchase directly on the merchant's shop.

I’ve seen many other similar projects out there and I can’t understand what they are doing to be considered interesting (this is even in the “trending now” on OpenSea…)  This is not a rant… I’d like to understand what I’m missing of this kind of project.

""" I don’t understand why many people are so surprised by this, that politics are somehow finding their way into crypto and into the market. It is only natural. Politics is not this black wolf that haunts the world, it’s a healthy system that we have made, just like finance itself, and it was only time before politics got involved.   In fact, politics in crypto only legitimizes crypto itself. It means it’s no longer a toy for a few fanatics online and now a serious asset of the world. It’s being attacked and venerated here and there, and this only makes crypto better either way.   Eventually, crypto will be a part of the financial future. Whether we see this yet or not. It will be. This is because it already is. It’s already finding its way.   Imagine how many tokens are being pushed out or banned. And how many tokens are being heavily endorsed and pushing INTO the country. Imagine how big NFTs have gotten and their usage by the governments later on   Imagine if governments started using NFTs as a currency base instead of gold lmao. Imagine if they started hoarding cryptopunks or bored apes or Royal Falcons Club. This could be the future of the market and the future of us all.

"Trumpy Dumpy is a committed project that aims to give a concrete role in your investment by making the news run around the politicians we trolling. The politicians will react, and the media will react, youtube will react, twitter will react, a chain reaction of marketing opportunities we don't have to pay for.  We don't have enough people to start phase 1 of the project mainly because when people look at this, they don't know what we are about. They hate, ignore, infomercial me about NFTs, or say it's a scam.  I'm a pretty pissed off American that just got screwed by Biden's policy, which is why I am using this image as the troll face for government. I don't align with trumps whatever shit, but I know it creates a reaction. Don't care about personal beliefs, just want to talk about facts, NFTs Do Make People Money. And how often do little guys like us get a chance to hear about a promising project that isn't promoted by a celebrity? The origin of this story will be, a group of online individuals upset at the government, found a peaceful way to demonstrate their protest and make money from it.

"What is a good value to place on your NFTs if you are a beginner?   As an artist you always look at the time spent and thus value your work based on this and the quality, putting a low value seems a little insulting. However I am aware that as a new unknown artist on the NFT platform you need to get people interested in your work and that may mean setting a low price.

Say a real-estate investor wants to sell part of his rental property as an NFT (50%), and promises through a contract that some amount of the income (50%) will be payed, in crypto, to the account that owns the NFT.  Would there be a way for this to be done? Can one find out the current owner of an NFT, and send that account Bitcoin/Ethereum/Whatever?

As a diabetic with a foot injury the chances of of amputation will always be high and for that reason I've decided to mint my injured foot as a NFT. With the purchase of this NFT you will own the rights to my foot in the likely case of an amputation. The NFT also includes a a tissue culture of my foot, as well as a photo of my injured foot as a NFT every year for as long as I'm on possession of my foot. It is not illegal to buy or sell human remains in the US.     Why am I doing this? Why not. Your jpeg doesn't come with shit, mine come with flesh. It's the first body part to be minted as a NFT.

"Non-Fungible Token is a new-age digital asset that has changed how asset trading is done worldwide. Previously before the introduction of NFT, ownership of digital assets was not possible; NFT allows the users to tokenize and have ownership of the asset. The emergence of NFTs has allowed digital artists and content creators to better monetize their work and reach out to secondary markets that generate revenue through loyalty earnings. Parallelly, NFT collectors, gamers, crypto investors, and others are making profits through NFT trading, which is booming exponentially.  Blockchain is a notable technology that powers non-fungible tokens and the NFT marketplace. The number of networks supporting NFTs is expanding, but most of these networks are cut off from each other, making it difficult to perform cross-chain trading across different networks.

"Why do most collections contain 1000+ nfts? Is it possible to have a collection with only 5 or 10 original/ different nfts?   And I see everyone says community is so important, but how does one create a community? I’ve used Instagram and Facebook for years to try to get my art out there and even with so many hashtags I’ve never been lucky. I can’t even imagine the frustration in doing the name with nfts.   I’m asking this because I keep reading about how so many nft collections fail, yet I know of someone (friend of a friend) who has built a solid community in just a month and has been making good enough money off her nfts that she quit her job. She’s just a regular person.   So how exactly do you even begin to create a community?

"There was reportedly a bug in the front-end of the popular Non-Fungible Token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea. This would have allowed users to buy popular NFTs at their previous offer price. It seems that the bug found is common in Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) NFT collections. The bug operator managed to buy them at their old offer price. He was then able to sell them at their current market price, which is currently higher. The NFTs that appear to be affected are: BAYC #9991, BAYC #8924 and MAYC #4986. There is one user, named 'jpegdegenlove', who is now suspected of exploiting this bug. In total, the user would have earned 332 Ethereum from these actions, which currently amounts to approximately $754,000, or $667,000.

Ik its a different kind of NFT from the normal one which many people are using on their Profiles but Imagine you in the metaverse and you get a change to showcase a piece of art with music that gives the viewer an experience so moving it adds much more value to your entire collection. Being so Unique that there is only one of this out on the blockchain anyone who buys this not only gets to say he has one of my greatest compositions that I have ever made but also a chance to support an artist do a lot more in music.

"I was browsing through opensea and came across several different NFT's that had a huge block of seemingly garbled random text in the description. There's no other information in the description so I was just wondering what's the point? Is it that effective on spamming the search, seo, rankings etc, is that the point?  Most of the ones I was looking at didn't have frozen metadata so couldn't I just delete the text if I bought one or is unfrozen meta is something only changed/deleted by the creator?

We’re already seeing games like PizzaBucks where player can race cars and also own NFT cars, houses and display their NFT art there too.

This is starting to look like when we were crazy about ICOs in 2016. We bought all sorts of things that seemed like crypto because we believed that they would excel like Bitcoin.   One that comes to mind is Swisscoin. They were a Ponzi scheme that claimed to be a crypto company. They made millions of dollars of unsuspecting people and disappeared into the thin air.

"   Summanus (Latin Summānus) is the god of night (daylight) thunder. Jupiter, with similar qualities, is the god of lightning and thunder during the daytime. The precise nature of Summanus was unclear even to Ovid. Pliny thought he was of Etruscan origin and was one of the nine thunder gods. Varro, however, lists Summanus among the gods he considers of Sabine origin, and among the gods to whom King Titus Tatius dedicates the altars (arae) as a result of a vote. Paulus Diaconus considers him the god of thunder. Georges Dumézil argued that Summanus would represent the uncanny, violent, and awe-inspiring element of the gods of the first function associated with heavenly sovereignty. The dual aspect of the heavenly sovereign power will be reflected in the duality of Varuna - Mitra in Vedic religion and in the duality of Summanus - Dius Fidius in Rome. The first deities of these couples embodied the violent, nocturnal, mysterious aspect of sovereignty, while the second reflected its reassuring, daylight, and legal aspect.

" We all know how popular NFT projects got in 2021, and I believe that year may be dubbed ""the Year of NFTs."" They are currently transforming our entire globe.    According to what I've read, many people expect that NFTs will be employed in a variety of ways in the future. Some believe that when we fly, we will not need boarding cards and will instead rely on our NFTs to board an aircraft.     This piqued my interest, and I couldn't help but conduct further research into it all, which is how I came upon PhoenixDao.   They have this concept where you can swap your NFTs for tickets to all kinds of events through their dApp, and when I read that, I had to wonder whether we will be utilizing NFTs to go into various public events in the future.

"If you have some failure stories of creating or treating NFTs, or maybe you've fallen victim to a scam, I think it could be helpful for beginners.  My short story: I was leaning about Ethereum smart contacts and decided to create my own NFT collection from scratch, i.e. by writing and deploying a smart contact using Solidity programming language. I was realistically not hoping to actually sell anything, but for the sake of bragging about it, I decided to list my collection on OpenSea.  It was quite difficult due to scarcity and low quality of documentation/tutorials, and I made a mistake in the smart contact. Namely, I forgot to add meta-transactions support. After I listed my collection on OpenSea, I found out I can't sell NFTs via auctions. (That's what meta-transactions support is for. Basically, it would allow OpenSea to pay gas fees for my smart contact.) I can still sell and transfer items, but no auctions.  Luckily, I've only spent a few dollars, because that was on Polygon, not Ethereum. Could have been a big mistake.",0.6536,0.135,0.714,0.152
"In 2021, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) were put on the map. Celebrities are fighting for them; plenty of new businesses have entered the market; and the foundations of NFT infrastructure have been established, opening the path for even more growth in 2022 but also raising fears that NFTs are a passing trend.       NFTs are something you should definitely focus on in 2022, in my view. Many people think that in the future, we will utilize NFTs for a variety of reasons; for example, some people predict that we will stop using objects that we use today and instead use an NFT. After doing some research on prospective NFT efforts, I came across some organizations that are using NFTs in their projects.        One of these companies is Meteora. They want to carry out this idea, according to which you may simply sell your music master and ownership contract as a standard NFT, as far as I can tell. This, in my opinion, might be a great project in 2022 because I believe we will be using NFTs a lot more in the future.

""" When you’re getting shilled by a marketer, they always try to push doubt out of your mind, and try to confuse you with big words and elaborate schemes. They always make their projects loud and obnoxious, complicated to understand and simple to use. They always make it super attractive yet a shell from the inside. Once you see this, run.   Never get rid of doubt 100%. Doubt is important, it keeps you aware that there might be risk and you should take notice. Never disregard fear completely, there’s a reason it exists within you. The things you fear, are often things you should.   When you take a look at a new prospect, that has not been heavily studied in the market yet, take for example the Royal Falcons Club, keep a keen eye on their mechanisms, their team, and their funders. If the projects isn’t fully studied yet, it is your duty to study it. For your sake, pay attention to the small things, because they add up quick.""",0.6673,0.086,0.803,0.111

"Hi I am brainstorming a new NFT based business that would create NFTs for local realtors/home buyers when they buy/sell a house ( and perhaps other uses ). I know a little about the process but thats it, just a little. I have some questions:  \-could the NFT be a PDF file that contains the title, home inspection, sales contract, loan info , construction history, current photos / videos of the the site and house?  \-could the NFT be minted by me?  \-I know the NFT would somehow get to the ethereum blockchain and live forever, but does each client have to create their own wallet? That might be an issue as it is not easy for the average person. Thus this might be the issue that makes my business model non feasible.   \-could the NFT be minted by Loopring (or other ) and then stored on Piñata ( or other )? Or is there 1 company that handles both the minting and the storage but still incur Layer 2 low gas fees ( like Loopring ) and then securely Web 3.0 stored ( like piñata )?  \-perhaps more of a realtor question but would I need the NFT to be Notarized and also contain that in the NFT file? If so, could I become my own Notary or is that a conflict of interest?  \-I know there must be people doing this already but this would be a 'local' service in my area, I am not trying to start big worldwide business.

"I wanted to get some general input from the crypto/NFT community.. Bare with me while I try to explain.  I’ve been wanting to create my own NFT. All of the biggest NFT collections have something that makes them valuable; i.e. exclusive perks, incentives, rewards, etc. and that’s one thing I have been struggling with is coming up with the “wow factor” to make my NFT enticing. However, I have one idea, and that is a hand-drawn NFT collection.  By hand-drawn, I don’t mean creating 5 different hats, 3 different heads, 7 different eyes, etc. in Photoshop, then using some scripts to create the 5,000 different variations. By hand-drawn, I mean sitting down at a table with pencils/markers and drawing out base designs for different layers, then drawing out all the different variations on individual pieces of paper. This would make every single piece in the collection uniquely-unique because no two eyes/hats/shoes/etc. would be exactly the same, despite being “same”.  Obviously I have to put a lot more though into this, come up with more ideas, do more research, etc, but I personally feel like a completely hand-drawn NFT collection would be enticing in it’s self.  I guess I’m not really sure what I am asking, but what is the Crypto/NFT community’s thoughts on this?",0.689,0.03,0.898,0.072

But if the person who gave you the painting was trustworthy, you might search for the nearest art expert to confirm its authenticity. The expert would go to your home and examine the painting’s composition. If the expert thought it was in Da Vinci’s style, the expert would call a team of appraisers to see if it was a well-painted fake. This might seem over-the-top, but how else are you supposed to know if the painting is an original?  https://livecoin24.com/guide-to-nfts-what-you-should-know/",0.6917,0.034,0.885,0.081

Mint now delayed reveal button  Hello I’m looking for information on how to creat my nft minting button and smart contract.  I’m looking for a mint now button then when you mint you get “a box” then after 24 hours of holding that box in your wallet it will open to reveal the nft from the collection.   I also want the NFT’s to allow for burning them to get coins that can be used to buy other NFT’s.  Or if you want to stake them you can.  Is this possible and where can I find information to build this on a budget.   Thank you.,0.7003,0.018,0.89,0.092

"Hi, I’m wondering how much I can make if I release a 10k nft collection?  To release a 10k nft collection, I’ll need to let people mint them (I cannot mint every nft :) ). Each minting will be, example, 0.08 eth. So I’ll get every 0.08 eth right? Maybe I’ll need to pay the gas fee, it will be around 0.03 so I’ll get 0.05 for each minting?  If It sold out, 10k minting will be 500 eth?  I personally think that is too much. Can anyone explain to me please ?:)",0.7059,0.015,0.917,0.068
