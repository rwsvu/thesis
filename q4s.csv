"Hello, I have a photo collection and I wanted to see if people might be interested in purchasing them. The best way seems to make them NFTs. The problem is that some of my best photos have logos and famous people in the background (eg. Coca Cola logo on a billboard in the background, a famous celebrity in the background, etc.). The photos are mine, but not sure if I am allowed to sell these because of copyright issues as the logo/celebrity is in the background, but it very much a part of the theme of the photo's message. Any help would be greatly appreciated. THANK YOU!",0.9535,0.037,0.787,0.176

"There are currently more than 3,000 different types of digital currencies on the cryptocurrency market, the best known being Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin and Litecoin. Now we have to make room for maricoin, the world's first cryptocurrency aimed at the LGTBI community and which, moreover, is Spanish. Despite its pioneering status, it has generated great interest, causing a long waiting list for all those who want to invest in this currency, to do so it is necessary to enter the following link.    Behind this idea we find the Madrid businessman Juan Belmonte, known for his chain of hairdressers Juan por Dios, who, together with his team, has explained that from 31 December, it will be possible to quote and use this cryptocurrency in 25 'gayfriendly' establishments that are distributed in the neighbourhood of Chueca (Madrid), Maspalomas (Gran Canaria), Ibiza or Barcelona.    Same rights  Maricoin was invented for all those people who ""do not have the same rights"", as Belmonte explains in a promotional video on Youtube that already has more than 10,000 views, since this cryptocurrency ""is going to unify us, is going to give us power in this globalised capitalist world"", adds the entrepreneur.   In addition, Francisco Álvarez Cano, the CEO of maricoin, declares that apart from being unique for being created by and for this group, ""it will also have value as a means of payment for any transaction while becoming a tradable asset on an exchange"".      Project underway  As Belmonte explains, the project has already started to work, although it is not yet listed, and already has ""associations and organisations that support the LGTBI collective"" as well as ""more than 20 businessmen in Chueca"" and they plan to create a seal ""of quality, of equality, that will make all the people who use maricoin know that this business is supporting gender and sexual equality"".    The creators define it as ""a social, ethical, transparent and transversal means of payment"", with which, if everything works, they will be able to operate on the stock exchange from 2022, and what they are also looking for is for maricoin to enter an even wider market. According to the project's promoters, during the first quarter of next year, maricoin will be listed on Algorand's main exchanges and, if everything works out, it will continue on Binance, i.e. worldwide.      Possible future  As the currency has adopted the 'altcoin' model, its value is not like that of the euro or the dollar, but depends on supply and demand. During the month of January, the idea is to issue 250 million dollars worth of maricoins (the sum of 50 to the value of 1 euro) and those who want to buy them will have to do so for the value of the moment.    More and more different social groups are looking to have their own 'crypto', which is why time will tell if there is a future for maricoins. In the meantime, at the next Gay Pride it is expected that there will be acceptance and it is hoped to be able to finance the festivities with these cryptocurrencies.",0.9894,0.006,0.903,0.091

An idea that was suggested to me was to come up with an NFT project (1,000 or up to 5,000) unique NFTs.

That way, if you don't think it is a doable project for a newbie, I'll focus my efforts for his care on something else.

"First of all I just wanna apologize if this May seems like a no brainer or something really obvious, but I just wanna be 100% sure before fully starting out with this! Thank you  Alright so I’ve just started out on OpenSea. I’ve got 8888 .PNGs that I’m ready to upload. I’ve paid for the “initialize your wallet” fee which was for me apparently $22 and the “OpenSea access to your NFT” fee which was almost $3 . However from what I had read and heard from before this seems waaaaaay to cheap. I’ve heard that it could be somewhere around $70-$300 Initialize the account and $10-$30 for the OpenSea access to NFT. Now I know that the prices to go up and down but this much? Does this mean that there will be a lot of other fees I’ll have to pay for when uploading these 8888 pieces or just later on? Because I have read that you’ll have to pay when accepting offers and things like that  Also on most of the videos I’ve seen with people using these bots when bulk uploading NFT they all select Polygon because of there not being any gas fees there and they’ve all said that Ethereum will be way to expensive is that just because of those 2 one time gas fees or is it something else that occur if you upload a HUGE amount of NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain? because it wouldn’t be really fun to upload 8888 pieces and then boom now you’ll have to pay this huuuuge fee because of the amount you have uploaded.  Once again sorry if this seems like something super obvious just trying to stay on the safe side to avoid some out of nowhere crazy fees.

"Hey guys what's up? I have a question for you... I'm getting a lot of messages from ""art traders"" profiles telling that my NFT ART is amazing and saying that they'll be able to sell it for at leats 1eth if I buy one of their advertisement packages and working strategies for someting like 50$. So my question is... If you think that my art is ""amazing"" and worth of 1Eth wouldn't be better if you bought it for, let's say, 0.03Eth and resell it for 1Eth? Or do you really rather profit only 50$? What's the logic behind that? I'm having a tough time trying to understand. The whole purpose of tokenizing something like ""art"" is the trading possibilities, isn't it?",0.8986,0.03,0.854,0.115

"hello,   I am an artist that wants to commit to nft's as well. All the tutorials on youtube are making it seem like it is so easy and I wanted to ask if it is really the case.   Also, the small research I have made people suggested rarible for beginning. (Do you agree?)   And I don't know which wallet to use if you have any suggestions as well that would be so appreciated. With the wallet and everything, I know that there needs to be some gas money and the estimations are between 100 or 200.

"  *Processing video 0m8tqeozvvj81...*     “Your fly is open, America”. Back to the Future is one of the greatest cinematic trilogies to ever grace the silver screen. But one fact a lot of people may not know is that the alternate 1985 timeline in BTTF2 was inspired by hotel and casino magnate Donald Trump. The same Donald Trump, who in the most unlikely of scenarios was elected leader of the free world in 2016. This piece “Fractures in Time”, is an amalgam of pop culture, politics, and social commentary, staged as a pop-art exhibit. Can’t get more meta than that. See what I did there? Enjoy!

"I wondered for a long time if  NFTs could be used for purchasing land in the physical world especially because physically lands are more expensive. I researched about this possibility and my research findings led to fractional NFT real estates.  In digital spaces, fractionalization often refers to sharing costs and ownership rights of NFTs that represent digital artwork and in the physical world, fractionalized NFTs, combined with tokenization, allows you to split costs and ownership rights of real-world assets like real estate. Fractional NFT real estate is simply tokenized ownership of real estate assets that are split and shared between multiple people.  I also found out that of these, Futurent(https://futurent.io) is undoubtedly the industry leader, thanks to its multi-sector trading platform and cross-chain support.

I am really having a hard time finding information online as any time I search for anything like ""NTF as app"" or ""code as an NFT"" all I find are things like ""how to mint your own NFTs"" or ""Top 10 android apps you can make NFTs with"".

I would like to say a missive thankyou to everybody here on reddit for all the insight and knowledge to settings one of these up. As a massive thank you, I am having a HUGE discount on 100 of the collectables, anybody who purchases one of these particular collectables will also get a receive another random collectable from another 100 collectables I am setting aside. As a part of the thankyou this deal will only be advertised on reddit for 72 hours or until they are sold, more info below.  Fullmoon is the first race I introduce in my serious and consists of the Werewolves. The collection will contain 10,000 collectables ranging in rarity (pack rank) and there will also be 5 legendary wolves.  Each werewolf will have it's rank in the pack, either the Alpha, Beta, Delta or Omega. Each pack will consist of 20 wolves and also have their own unique Sigel.  The collection tag in OpenSea is NFT-Fullmoon, even if you're not interested in purchasing any of the collection please show your love and favourite your best wolves  DISCOUNT  As a part of the discount I will be massively lowering the price of 5 packs (500 wolves) from Werewolf #501 to Werewolf #600. Anybody who purchases one of these 100 wolves will then receive a random werewolf from Werewolf #601 to Werewolf #700...  Also those interested this is the perfect time to bag a full pack as there are 5 up for grabs, I imagine once I get this collection off the ground this could be where the real value is.

Players will be able to:  \- Train, equip and prepare Champions for deadly exchanges  \- Forge weapons, armor and gear from the very bones of fallen opponents  \- Battle for land ownership to build forges to let you craft imbued gear  \- Splice the essence of Champion with others to create more powerful Champions  \- Survive and thrive in a world that respects and admires glory in combat  \- Work with friends to form alliances and gain the favor of the Emperor  \- Amass enough victories, ascend and claim a place amongst the ranks of the Eternals themselves    Later, Jam City will introduce additional Champions tiers with varying levels of in-game earning potential and access to gear. Champion NFTs can be used in the game to find, socialize and battle other players.     In later versions, Jam City will make it possible for players to build structures and forge fight gear for their characters to use or sell on the player-to-player marketplace.

I'm trying to learn how to mint them and learn about the marketplace. I'm using google and hunting around for stuff to read or watch. It's like every article I find is written by people fluent in Latin, read by other people fluent in Latin, and using Latin terms to explain how to learn Latin. Everyone agrees that the basic concepts are spelled out really well, but it's still all in Latin. How does somebody who doesn't speak the language actually start to learn?  I've learned about other complex topics on subreddits, starting from zero. I'd read FAQs and intro posts, follow questions, read the weekly ""beginner"" threads, and so on. NFT is one of those things where I can't figure out the first step because it's always defined with a dozen other things that I need to know first, and it's a closed circle of unhelpfulness.  I feel like I'm starting to understand how significant the concept is, but I haven't the faintest idea how to get started.

But let's say I want to give value to my tiered collection - if I wanted to make the lowest tier worth $50 from the get-go and the highest few $1000 how can I do this without paying $100+ in gas fees on each transaction as the seller/buyer. Exactly when does the NFT gain its value at my desired price? I'm currently under the assumption that I have to ""buy"" my own tokens to give them value.

Whatever we imagine, our amazing artist can bring to life. I would also consider bringing on a partner who would invest and thus take an outsized portion of the mint fees compared to other team members.   With 280 members in our community and a modest following of 144 on Twitter, we have a lot of growth to go before mint day. Our [art](https://imgur.com/a/fXs8ANw) is of an excellent caliber, thanks to an excellent artist we got to join. With the right approach by another experienced individual, I hope to give this wonderful art and artist the community they deserve.",0.9924,0.0,0.763,0.237

"We have all known cryptocurrencies for some time now, but since 2020 a new 'hype' has arisen, the NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). This new hot topic is ready to take over the online world. But can the NFT market function independently without the crypto coins? And vice versa, can the NFTs be ignored when we talk about cryptos?  I think that the crypto world and the NFT world are increasingly merging as one. And personally, I think this is a good development for both markets. They will both be strengthened by this, and more people will find their way through this 'new' merged world.  There are so many projects right now, such as Women Empowerment Token, The Sandbox, and White Whale Terra, waiting to soar to great heights. All projects based on the creation, purchase, and sale of NFTs. It might sound a bit scary for most of us, but after all, I think it all will be worth it!",0.9418,0.042,0.832,0.127

"Hello there. I'm new here so I'm not sure how this subreddit works exactly but I've just recently learnt about NFTs and their value in the future. Could someone explain to me how they work in greater depth for the following:  1. Why are NFT images worth so much and why are people paying for them exactly? (what's attracting these people basically), 2. How are NFTs created, from making the NFT image to getting it out there and sold? 3. Can anything be an NFT, for example games, software, music, etc... 4. How does one start making an NFT. I have understood that knowing how to code will help generate them automatically, but what about hosting the NFT on a server. How does someone pay for it? And how is it ensured that no one can copy it or re-create it themselves without me or the creator of the NFT knowing?  I hope these aren't too many questions, but I'm really curious about how it works and it's the first time I've ever gone into learning about blockchains and crypto, so this would really be insightful. Thanks in advance and have an amazing day!",0.987,0.027,0.806,0.167

I’m curious how you overcome missing out on drops on sites like royal.io and sound.xyz.   From what I gather these used to work on a first-click-first-won type of process.

There are so many different blockchains out  there and I'm having a hard time choosing the one I want to go with. The  following are the the most important factors for my project in  descending order of importance (i.e. smart contracts are the most  important):  * Complex smart contracts * strong nft support * ease of wallet use * low minting fees * Staking * possibility to create custom Tokens * interoperability with eth * transaction speed  There  are so many blockchains like Harmony, Solana, Avalanche, Cardano,  Fantom etc., but so far from what I've been reading maybe Harmony and  Solana are the most suitable? What are your opinions on this. (maybe  there's also some other blockchain that I just haven't come across yet).  I  haven't mentioned Etherium, since it's crazy high gas fees seem non  feasible currently and who knows when ETH2.0 will come out.

"Hello everyone.....I'm a young orthopedic surgeon who is interested in how NFTs and blockchain backed technology will break into other consumer markets. Being in healthcare, I can definitely see the need and the utility as we move further away from traditional paper record keeping/record transfer to technology backed/profile based records. I'd love to use NFT technology to break into that market. At this point, my partner and I are looking to MINT an NFT collection. This is for two purposes:    1. I would like to attempt to generate a community for this goal. The goal of the project, in addition to below, would be to give access to initial interested peoples to invest in the push towards that technology. 2. Will Donate 20% of profits to a voted upon medical/healthcare base charity. If the contribution to public charity can be proven, then the real revenue potential could be presented seriously in that space. I think that is the first step to breaking into using this technology in healthcare. 3. We hope to use this process to generate some very interesting, comedic, visually appealing healthcare based character artwork to be sold on the NFT marketplace.  I'd love to get some feedback.
