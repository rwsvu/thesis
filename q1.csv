"For context I've personally invested around 5k. I think the project has good potential but.....  1) They have  210k members in Dcord but very few are active, most are bots and those that are active spam the same things   2) Their socials are not well received.  User interactions are poor. Unsurprising when they fake posts about how they've personally sold NFT work 400k+  3) Their communication is poor. They claim to be transparent but then say they've got a 100k marketing push coming out and then don't show where money was spent. I can only assume it was spent on bots for the server.  4) They consistently underdeliver whilst over promising. On numerous occasions I have been promised high value returns with staking that got slashed when It eventually came out  5)Their drops are shoddy. People have been able to mint far more than planned and public sale opened early during WL mint.  6) The team is of a very young age. (whilst there is nothing wrong with this. It all point to lack of experience and poor management)  7) The mods and team are power hungry and fragile. Any genuine discussion that is focused on developing the project is considered FUD and Banned. In essence if its not spam to grind levels of pure propaganda to promote the project its banned.  8) You are not allowed to talk about sales in any capacity even within public channels. I was talking to someone who I was going to offer a cheaper bundle to before I got banned.  9)There is no system to go back into discords and dispute things despite the fact the community manager said it was a misunderstanding.  10) I had to sell one of my collection for personal reasons to which I genuinely received a scalding. It also caused the floor to dip by nearly a third!  11) The owners/mods have a large collection of legendries  12) They paid a whale to buy over 50eths worth to manipulate floor price because it was tanking so hard  13) The majority of their holders don't understand the NFT Crypto space and have aped in and lost lots of money    You may notice an overtly negative overtone. I don't like to be unfair or untrue. However I have invested not only a lot of money but a lot of time and been treated really poorly.

Eventually, madness as the virus infests them and begin to alter their DNA. The virus causes organic tissue to fuse and meld with the host, blending their flesh. Eventually, their body grows to around 8 feet tall and can look very different depending on what they originally fuse with.

"Recently I began to write a script for a heist action film called ""Non-fungible kid"".     The main character is 20 yo kid who have to pay his debt by being a hacker for a gang of people who are performing crypto and NFT heists. His parents died in a car accident and only thing he remembers about them is how just before car crash his dad gifted him a usb-drive on his birthday and then he never saw his parents again. There was nothing on USB-drive but a .jpeg low quality image of Pepe the frog. Now he wears this USB-drive on a chain around his neck as a memory.    They are about to heist the convoy that transports the biggest supply of NFT in the world, the convoy called ""The blockchain"". They successfully pull off the heist (cool scenes with car crashes, people shooting AK-47 and some people die here and there). They get into the main truck in the convoy and start stealing Hard drives full of NFT. When they come back to the hideout they check the drives and they have all the best stuff on them in HQ .png files: punks/apes/Beeple arts/toadz/kongz and etc. They all are happy and the main guy in the crew (""Boss"") who is planning all the heists tell the kid he is almost free-to-go with one last job to be done.    The crew go to spend some money when kid sitting in his favorite computer club meets an E-thot streamer whose streams he was watching for years. They talk and like each other almost immediately, so E-thot asks him if he want to live in her 3-story mansion and play with her toes if he donates her $1B on her livestream. He wants to, but he remember that he need to do one last job and rejects her for now to not put her in danger and make enough money to afford it.    The heist day comes and their target appears to be some sort of unreleased NFT which will blow up at market in few weeks and generate unreal amount of profit. The heist is easy as hell and they are very surprised about it. When they steal the hard drive with NFT's they go back to hideout to check it out and realize that all it have there is their own real photos. Suddenly a rocket hit the window killing one man from the crew and damaging others.     Turns out that the main dude set them up to cyber-police in return of leaving the country freely with all the NFT's they stole for the whole time the group was operating. They are trying to leave the building, several of them die, but two of them including the kid escape and they are driving to airport to commit vengeance on their ""boss"". They are late and the plane has took off already but kid have a plan, they storm the airport control point and kid hijacks the plane remotely making it crash killing the ""boss"" (and 100 more passengers).    The kid is sentenced 5 lifetime sentences and 3 dead penalties but they live in USA so he leaves the jail in 4 years. He wants to go back to the E-thot but he don't have any money. Then he remembers about his flash-drive on the neck and all pieces come together in his mind. Turns out that pepe.jpeg is actually a very rare NFT which have a price of $20B. He sells it and the film ends with him sucking on the E-thot big toe.     The end",-0.9867,0.118,0.811,0.071

"I’ve spent way too much money on buying games on my PS4 over the last 7 years.   Last year, I moved cities and purchased an Xbox  and left my PS4 at my parents’ place. I wanted to buy some DLCs for games I’ve previously played on my PS4 but realise that I’d have to buy the entire game all over again on Xbox just to play those DLCs.   And that just seems stupid and wrong. I’ve already paid for that game. I have proof of purchase on file for that platform. But because of being on a different platform, I’m forced out of accessing that DLC.  Both I and the gaming publisher lose out. They lose my custom and I lose out on playing their additional content.   **So I’ve begun to wonder, can NFT technology somehow solve this dilemma? If in the future, our game purchases were represented via NFT tech, perhaps we could be able to switch between marketplaces and platforms with that ‘proof of purchase’?

And of course I realized whose graffiti it was, and that it was really destroyed ...  A thought immediately shot through my head that it urgently needs to be recreated in the NTF. After all, it's not for nothing that the creators recorded a static frame several seconds long right in front of the picture? Not from above, not from the side, but clearly opposite ...  I immediately created This NTF [https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x2953399124f0cbb46d2cbacd8a89cf0599974963/51788041722116964364677670716898017067740247347678725932908398911862245163009](https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x2953399124f0cbb46d2cbacd8a89cf0599974963/51788041722116964364677670716898017067740247347678725932908398911862245163009) and submitted an application to the Banksy [https://pestcontroloffice.com/](https://pestcontroloffice.com/) to determine the possible ownership of it.  From my assumptions it follows that this is a kind of performance from Banksy (I have many assumptions about the purpose for which this was done, but let's say that this is just such an action of unprecedented generosity, in which all the viewers of this TV show participated, but only one could win)  The one who is the first to guess that this graffiti is no longer in the real world, and the only option for its further existence in the world of art can continue only in the form of its digital display, because it no longer exists in another form.  I don’t know (and no one, in my opinion, still knows for sure how much the NTF determines the ownership of various works of art, perhaps this is one of the reasons for which this performance was performed), but if the author of the real work didn’t claim it rights in digital form (NTF) knowing that his work will be destroyed (and this was one of his conditions, the second was that it was Christopher Walken and no one else who would destroy her, perhaps to give it more value) makes it possible for anyone to do this.  Perhaps you will say some kind of crazy ... But how many coincidences do not you think?  And answering the question: why is it so expensive? My answer is: Banksy drew it and destroyed it by Christopher Walken, in front of millions of viewers, and as I personally think: this is generally the first precedent for a new category of NTF in which atators can transform existing Easter eggs into gifts for the audience.

Before payment, he sent us his wallet address… not specifying that is was a coinbase erc20 ETH address. Right after he sent it I asked if I could sent half in erc20 USDT and the other half in bep20 BUSD and he said yes go ahead. So me thinking I was sending my money to a metamask, I sent it. Shortly after he told us we sent it to his wrong address and that our $5k wasn’t able to be recovered… partially our fault for not clarifying, but also cmon man you told us to send it!  Anyways, we tried negotiating with him to give us some sort of deal/discount because of his poor communication… he said no we need to send another $5k. We were in contact with his business partner and his partner told us we could send $3k and he’d cover the rest (so we sent it).   What do you know, Chubbs says no way can this happen, he needs the full $5k.   We tell him never mind we want a refund as we cannot afford that after losing $5k. After asking for the refund he blocks our account on Instagram, blocks our phone numbers, and turns off all commenting on his insta account as he is afraid we’ll expose him.

(Great for pushing your ideals amirght?) 2. The marketing isn't pushing for utility because its just frankly not there. They released images of half cooked avatars with little to no effort in the artistic side. They blame randomization. A good portion of the marketed avatars even on their opensea banner were never released and don't exist. 3. The mods are unresponsive when you question something. Especially the marketing team. Kalinfinity (A marketing Mod) decided to emotionally ban me and two other people yesterday for comments made, that did not violate the rules. When asked why I was banned (and the other asked why he was banned) no response was given, we were both just simply blocked. This was done to a NFP holder, not even a rando user.  TLDR: Don't join a dead project ran by people who refuse to acknowledge their users and consumers who are there for the utility, not their viewpoints on life. Hopefully some of the consumers and advertisers like Champion see what this project really is. It's sad Daz3d is letting this be so mismanaged.",-0.9576,0.132,0.799,0.069
"So I was searching around for new nft projects and I thought I found a nice one and joined their d1scord server. Once on the d1scord server I followed some steps to get verified although I was doing something i would regret later on. I was redirected to a site where i had to connect with my metamask and it asked for my private key, I though it was suspicious but i did it any way(YES DUMB AS FUCK), nothing happened of course, so I dismissed it and left the d1scord server, a few hours later I notices some activity on my meta mask, funds were added, and then quickly transfered again, about 300 dollars in total. Of course i panicked and I checked my rarible and opensea and found out that 2 of my minted works were transfered to an unknown account. I'm a digital artist and was perplexed by this act, why would someone do this? I had almost nothing on my metamask, and only 2 nft's who weren't even that valuable (yet).",-0.9557,0.116,0.873,0.011

"Hi guys, I've been trading crypto for a while now, and have been following smart contracts ever since they were announced as a feature for Ethereum. However, something regarding recent developments with NFTs has been bothering me, mainly regarding the current image problem NFTs are facing, and I'd like a serious discussion about this, because I believe that the technology as a whole is facing a major risk of most people being permanently turned off by the mere mention of the word ""NFT"".  Inherently, from a computer science perspective, theres absolutely nothing wrong with NFTs. They are an important function of smart contracts that could be used as a means of decentralized transferrable ownership contracts... BUT....  What everyone (outside of this sub and others communities like this one) actually hates (warranted or unwarranted) is the most common implementation: selling JPG art for exorbitant sums of crypto. What should've been sidelined as gag after the proof-of-concept stage with CryptoKitties (no one complained about those, I'm just saying) became a sprawling ecosystem of extremely similar projects with everyone trying to cash in. I mean, ffs, these were supposed to be linked to smart contracts controlling ownership of real world items, people running their own stores, car rental/dealerships, real estate companies, banks, governments, etc, with no middlemen, no VISA/Paypal breathing down your neck the second you do something the Epsteins of the world don't like, you could set up a functioning economy connected to global infrastructure in third world countries with minimal setup. You even have this as the header for this sub, where are all of those projects? Why don't I see those types of projects being advertised heavily, yet I get a person in my DMs every single day telling me to mint BAYC version 937374929? I know this is ""early days, fast forward a few years and you'll see it"" but isn't it time already? When was that rule written, a few years ago? What's going on, devs?  Blockchain technology was supposed to put the collective power of the internet back in the hands of the many, but so far I have not seen this be the case, just more people selling for fiat instead of buying items for crypto outright. Selling for fiat should be done just to interact with the outdated government tax system at this point. For how long will this be tolerated? Hyper-inflation, corporate tyranny colluding with our government, massive corporations getting bailouts while small businesses are squeezed out, all this could be solved if we stop using a fiat banking currency, if we stop using centralized platforms and go back to the days of the wild west. Yes, it is more dangerous at first, because the surface of blockchain isn't fully built yet. But what's the most dangerous thing is if we continue on our current path while the foundation of our society crumbles under the surface of fiat infrastructure.   JPG NFTs are supposed to be proof of concepts. May we overcome this obsession upon our collective psyche, get out of our comfort zones, and climb out of the hellpit that is fractional reserve lending so that we can all be like kings in the new era, with no corporate authority telling us what we can or can't do within existing laws.  Anyway, that's been my rant. Sorry if I broke any rules or if this has been posted a million times but I just had to get this off my chest. If you have any real-world NFT projects you'd like to shill to me and everyone else, please do so in the comments below.",-0.9451,0.081,0.864,0.055

El ecosistema de las criptomonedas no solo está conformado por empresas que se dedican al universo del trading con criptodivisas, sino por otro tipo de empresas de servicios no financieros que también aprovechan las tecnologías como blockchain y todo lo que denominamos como finanzas descentralizadas para hacer un ecosistema cada vez más disruptivo y generador de empleos.      Si bien la salida de un token al mercado es algo que ocurre con frecuencia, no todos los tokens se dan a conocer con la misma rapidez. $WOLFY es un token que ha sabido entrar al mercado de las criptomonedas con algo que todos los expertos en la materia buscan: liquidez,        Este token se une a la competencia contra las grandes monedas, ofreciendo beneficios económicos que sus tenedores pueden obtener solo por conservarlo, aumentando la cantidad de incentivo con el tiempo que estos duren con él. De igual forma, todo aquel que posea un token WOLFY también será recompensado a través de mayores volúmenes de transacciones, que resultan en mayores tarifas, así como premios por distribución del mismo.       Los desarrolladores del ECOSISTEMA WOLF ofrecen, además, un mercado digital cuyo propósito es conquistar la financiera lucrativa mediante un proceso de estudio de bolsa. Al invertir en este token, estás ayudando a las organizaciones para la protección de los animales caninos, lo que significa que además de recibir ganancias por hacer Farming, también tu inversión podrá salvaguardar a una vida.       Pero esto no es todo lo que el ECOSISTEMA WOLF INU tiene para ofrecer, también cuentan con su nueva Marketplace de NFTs,  en donde podrás vender, comprar y apostar por los activos digitales del momento. Este ecosistema nos ofrece, a su vez, la posibilidad de poner a la venta nuestros propios activos coleccionables en su Marketplace, sin la intervención de terceros (para aquellos amantes de la descentralización).       WOLF INU no solo nos presenta la posibilidad de obtener retribuciones con su token WOLFY, sino que también nos brinda el acceso a un mercado que poco a poco se ha abierto un buen espacio en el mundo de las criptomonedas. Y es que invertir en activos digitales como lo son los NFTs vale la pena, ya que las ganancias por hacerlo serán mayores a corto o mediano plazo.       Wolf INU es un protocolo independiente e innovador que está aportando mucho al mercado financiero digital, por lo que vale la pena echarle un vistazo. Recordemos que activos digitales como Bitcoin y Ethereum comenzaron como pequeños proyectos con un precio pequeño de inversión, que trajeron grandes retribuciones a sus tenedores en poco tiempo. Así que, ¿estás preparado para obtener tu propio lucro digital?

"Like in the begining of bitcoin and ethereum. The People thought its a scam and nobody is going to buy it, Just because they dont know it the dont like it. I think the Golden Moments NFts are the New BTC. I could be wrong and they could be right that NFTs are worthless. But I like the Idea of being the person Who holds GM and display them in my home so much. No matter If they would fall full down and be worthless. So I will only buy more and more GM.   6 month - 1 year prediction. Partners Statue $60000 Iron Man $ 4500 C3PO $8500 R2D2 $13000  These 4 GM are in my eyes the best. What are your thoughts ?  Maybe there will be an BB8 Golden moment from star wars. But is C3PO and R2d2 not better and more loved ?  There will be probally like 10 more Golden Moments. But the ones from star wars and marvel has more fans that collect expensive stuff I think. So they will skyrocket.  And even if they dont, i will hold my GM And remember I bought my C3po  for 5400 and Iron man for 2400.  And still I like them to much that i wouldnt even cash out when they hit 7000 and 4000. I would only cash out if they are worth.  C3PO $40000 Iron Man $25000 So I hodl.  Just remember No body can time the market otherwise you would already be an miljonair, but you can speculate and try to find real value.   In my opinion we all should hodl our Golden moments because we rule the price if we would all not sell below $10000 then its worth $10000 and then investers see rising prices and are willing to get in for even $15000  So dont panic and remember a loss isnt a loss intill you cash.

We are a… form of company that manages pieces of unstable dimension on the intersections of Parallel Universes.  If you are reading this, it will most likely be your first time in business with us.  We have prepared this meeting as we feel you will need additional explanations.  We wonder if you know of the Butterfly Effect?  “Can the flutterings of a butterfly in Brazil affect the atmosphere, amplify over time and cause a tornado in Texas?”  Normally this is a sentence commonly quoted to explain the Chaos Theory. However, this can actually happen in unstable parallel dimensions!  The difference might be in that even a single movement of the antennae can split or destroy universe.  As such, these universes are unstable, fragile and full of Chaos.  You probably already know that the existing dimensions can infinitely split into countless dimensions from individual choices.  It’s inevitable that there will be a place to deal with problems as countless dimensions split on the %&amp;# axis.  These unstable dimensions were to be isolated, but we secretly got ***8,888*** Dimensional Pieces for special collectors  You will be able to purchase the randomly prepared Dimensional Pieces, and can own those dimensions.  # What is PUC?  The Parallel Universe Collector is a Solana-based NFT aimed at expansion of eight universes — Cthulhu/ Trader/ Ghost/ Soldier/ Mad Scientist/ Sci-Fi/ Steampunk/ Druid. Each of the eight universes has its own characteristics. The intersections of Parallel Universes created mixtures of many dimensions and we observed 8,888 unstable dimensions. You are able to get dimensions that can expand infinitely in the nested state depending on your decisions.   📷  **The Public Mint date : Dec/18/16:00(UTC)**     📷  **Mint Address :** [**https://mint.pucnft.io/**](https://mint.pucnft.io/)    📷 **Total Supply : 8888**   📷 Listed in ME ([https://magiceden.io/marketplace/parallel\_universe\_collector](https://magiceden.io/marketplace/parallel_universe_collector))",-0.8556,0.085,0.864,0.051

"   So, in yesterday's newsletter, Blockworks wrote about money laundering.  One of the points discussed were stolen NFTs and their value. I think he offered the most concise explanation of what an NFT is and how it works.  Basically, he explained why a stolen NFT loses its value since it can't be sold on OpenSea and you can't use it as a profile picture anywhere.  Your only chance is to sell it to someone that's either ignorant or doesn't know it's stolen for 20 to 40% of its value.  Another interesting idea was about KYC and its utility. Why and how you might wonder?  Well, to prevent ""dirty money"" and money laundering. As he puts it, hacking attempts can be discouraged, more institutional investors might feel safer and decide to put their money into digital assets thus increasing trust in this field and removing the criminal aura that is attributed to crypto-related businesses.   What do you think, have you read the newsletter? I'll leave you with a video about the biggest crypto scams: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy0QQKBCS78",-0.8243,0.142,0.743,0.114

I've watched many videos from different youtubers trying to explain, some podcasts and also twitter as well but no one ever mentions it.    I believe I understand NFTs, and how its the future. It creates values in items (e.g. a rare mount on WoW can be traded within each other once you're done with the game, rather than it sitting in your blizzard account collecting dust).    So that makes sense, I understand why people will pay big money for NFTs in the future, the question is, why are they worth so much now? For example what are you going to do with a Bored Ape? Its not like you can suddenly bring it to an online game. As of right now, there's basically no true use of it? Its just a collectable correct?     Lets say you can bring a Bored Ape into a game in the future, this is all speculation right? What happens if you can't. Why are people spending that much money on things now rather than wait for the game to actually come out and buy the NFTs from the game. E.g. Sandbox, Decentraland, Axie Infinity.     Even those games there, what happens if they die off and no one plays those games anymore? Is the million dollar land plot going to be worth nothing?

It will be a couple more.momths until I can get back to work and being alone at home, incapacitated, unable to go out at all, has made my depression and anxiety much worse. The only way I could cope is through food and art and as I am unable to move around and cook much more than instant noodles for the time being, I decided to draw pixel food and keep myself busy so that I can survive this isolation.

Don't play in the street. Don’t drink poison. Don’t play with fire. Don’t stick things in electrical outlets; and, don’t stick anything bigger than your elbow in your ear. These are just a few word of wisdom everyone has heard while navigating adolescence.  With SO many rules, written and unwritten, most days you were lucky you survived.  KIDS WILL BE KIDS examines the intersection of childhood and impending apocalyptic disaster where one set of rules is replaced with another. In a disaster setting, no matter your age, your city, race or culture, you become that child again – learning the new rules of your transformed society and struggling to survive from day to day.  If you are a “quick change artist” and adapt to your surroundings, not only can you survive but your chances increase to write, or even re-write, the rules that govern all.   \*\*\*\*\*\*  **Card Style Note**: The core image of each card is based on a vintage alphabet card from the Czech Republic.

" I have worked as a research engineer in a technology transfer department for a long time.  When  presenting new technologies to the public the idea is to find an  appealing use case so people can extrapolate and understand potential  applications.  The truth is, unless  the person you are talking to already has knowledge in the topic,  people just get stuck with what they inmediately see.  ""Ah,  I see, but this is not very useful."" ""Something else does the same  thing why do we need this?"" ""This is too big and clunky!"" ""Can it work  from a longer distance?""  As for  NFTs, a lot of proof of concept projects are going to appear, projects  for art, items for video games, media licenses and so on. Those examples  are not restrictive, meaning that there are other options available and  using an NFT could be more of an inconvenient than an advantage.  There  are use cases in which NFTs could be the only solution. We all know how  corrupt the system already is and there is a need to democratize  finances and certifications.  How  can it be that everytime I need a paper signed I need to go to a notary  to stamp it for a ridiculous sum of money? Why everytime I need to show  my university diploma I need to go to the university to pay a signed  copy that will be useless after 3 months?  As  seen early this year, brokers such as Robinhood or eToro cannot give  proof of ownership of company stock. In general nobody gives proof of  ownership, yet, they are able to take your money instantly. If stocks  where in the block chain it would be possible to keep ownership and  uniqueness  track. Any counterfeited asset would be miss dated from the  orignial batch.  So everytime I see  anti NFT talk in the front page of my feed I cannot but assume there's  an interest in delaying the implementation of such technologies as it is  not in the best interest of people who are happy with the current  system.",-0.6181,0.079,0.856,0.065

This being said, I've noticed that some projects with some really solid social media following, and really good fundamentals, have kept a very low floor, while others with the same or even worse metrics have their floor rise to about 10x minimum, not to mention, that the projects that have, recently, skyrocketed, haven't really appeared on my radar until one NFT has sold for 10Eth or something, it's almost like it's being kept hidden until it just shoots to the moon 🤔😅  Can anyone tell, or explain why this happens?

I work in the environment services business. All hazardous waste requires labeling and tracking using a manifest that must be signed by trained personnel. Waste manifest needs to be retained at least 5 years. I feel this would be a great use case for NFTs.  -Assign drum a waste NFT ID (included on label) -Only person with valid permissions can interact with NFT (ie up to date training) -When drum changes hands NFT ID label is scanned and ownership is digitally transferred creating an on-chain “chain of custody” -Results in real-time tracking of package and permanent record of custody transfer  You could even program a transaction to occur once waste is received by final person (ie disposal).

"    He wakes up in his little cramped apartment by the sounds of his upstairs neighbor’s f1cking. This is the third time it’s happened this week. It seems like they’re going for their fifth child. He gathers up the crumpled T-shirts off the floor and looks outside his window. It’s a dark and monochrome palette of grey buildings, white cars, at least they used to be white when they were bought, and loud colorful advertising boards everywhere, printed in large and massive fonts to catch the fast-attention span passerby into selling them something they don’t need. ‘I hate it here’ George thinks to himself. ‘I have to get out.’   He remembers this moment, and reminds himself why he is fighting, this is not a life he wants to lead, this is a life he was cursed with, and he must find a way out. He slops down in the one place left to sit in the massive noise that is his room, he grabs his fake Deats by Bre. Headphones in order to silence out the noise outside. And he starts up his computer and gets ready to start his day.   \&gt;go to desktop    \&gt;Run Axie Infinity   It may sound stupid to you, that someone in a shthole country like that would spend their day playing a game like Kitty Kart, Axie Infinity, or F1 Delta Time, instead of getting a job that will salvage what money, and pride they have left. Well, it’s strange to you because you’re watching from the outside. If George makes 5$ a day playing an NFT game, he makes more the average engineer in his country. Where he lives, the currency is inflated so bad, that any outside solid currency like dollars (or stablecoins in this case) is considered a fortune. I know this because this is what is happening in my country right now as I type is.   No one wants a bad fortune, but sometimes, we are just played a bad hand and there’s nothing we can do about it. We can either play the game like everyone else, or just keep pushing and going for the kill. You might find this hand to relate, but there is nothing more exhausting than living in a country where resources are low. Because once someone finds a money well, they get sniffed out by a pack of nearby neighbours, they can smell it like bloodhounds, it draws them in and near, and they will show absolutely no remorse in taking matters into their owns hands.   When resources are low, people often fight for scraps, and often to the death. This is why crypto games are presenting these citizens with a new hope, because as ridiculous as this sounds, these citizens are making a living outside their failing country, while they live in it still. They can make their good dollars on a game, and ensure their meal for the day.   Never make fun of someone making progress, no matter how slow.   They might be spending their lives behind a game, but they are making good progress, albeit very slowly.",-0.5701,0.111,0.77,0.119

The Path Less Traveled is a collection of 16 original 1 of 1 photographs of fine art landscapes by photographer/cinematographer Brent Kennedy. Most of the images feature mountains and/or aspen tree groves in the idyllic Colorado landscape, but the most notable feature of this collection was that every image was captured on medium format film.  Being captured on film gives you a quality that is lost in todays digital landscape. Not only does each image have its own unique character, but was scanned at an ultra high resolution of 10,000+ pixels in each dimension. This makes them large enough to be used in almost anything. Access to these ultra-hi resolution versions is exclusively reserved for buyers.  Will be dropping on 05-03-22 at noon!

"a few days ago, I bought an NFT from Opensea. This NFT allows you to stake your NFT on their project website to make their coin. So I connected my Metamask to the website and click on the stake option. After I clicked the button, the website said I need to establish a smart contract first and Metamask prompted me to approve a transaction that shows "" Approve for all"". The amount reflected there was just a minor gas fee. So I adjusted the max gas fee, approved the request, and slowly wait for it to get through overnight. When I woke up the next day morning, the request was approved but my ETH balance was gone and left with 0.00005 ETH. But other coins were left untouched.  I checked Ethscan and I realise my ETH was transferred to an unknown address a few minutes after my transaction with the NFT website was approved. The ETH lost is minimal. But I am wondering if my Metamask is compromised or something is wrong with the NFT project website. I have never revealed my seed word with anyone, the only suspicious thing I have done is approve the request from the NFT website.    *Processing img 1n9hm1etujf81...*",-0.4588,0.052,0.901,0.047

"Hello! I'm an artist new to NFT thing. I was contacted by a team to join as an artist. I had to do 5 characters, all of them having 180 different attributes/traits. The budget: $700 I signed a contract for unlimited time. The team is not a company tho. I was paid for the 5 characters, their bases. It was a whole almost 1 month process, because a piece it's very detailed, with a lot of shading and stuff. Now I had to go to the attributes part and when I noticed it took me 2 hours to finish just 1, I realized, what am I doing? Not just that it will take me A LOT to finish all of them, but I can make more money if I go and work at McDonalds for 1 month. This amount of work is huge, and not knowing and understanding NFT, I thought only the bases will be that complex and the accesories and stuff will be simple. But they request very detailed pieces with shading, rendering etc. Please help me, what should I do? I'm already so burnt out. I can barely stretch, my head hurts everyday and I'm just extremely tired. I can't negotiate now or ask for more money, because they told me at first, this is the budget, no more or less.",-0.4294,0.056,0.893,0.052

The marketing has gone pretty much as I expected it to and we've gathered as much as 80k hyped up members on our dscord. By what I see we should mint out in the first few hours once at that stage. However, I have a question that keep bugging me:   Is stealing minting funds from my partners a thing and if so, How can I protect myself from that happening to me?

Due to frequent limitations of cost and space for data storage on blockchain, only the ownership record is stored with metadata linking the original NFT content.

It implies that the content directed by the link is vulnerable to change or go offline ( due to 404 errors, rug pulls, broken links) at any time resulting in the permanent loss of original assets.

"Just a heads up that there's a post on a sub [WPT](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/rx8j4r/important_message/) that states NFT's were created by racists to make art inaccessible to Black people, that the N in NFT stands for the N-word and is an abbreviation for the slave trade, and a whole bunch of other really salacious stuff like racism is why apes, gold chains, and fast food are used in NFT's.   They are also claiming that racists are harassing Black people calling them NFT's.  Personally - if these things are true I would like know because I will see NFTs in a different light.   So many people hate NFTs that it would not surprise me if this was created to once again attack NFTs.   Any truth to any of this stuff?

"Hey Community. Recently, I've been getting back into crypto after taking about 9 months off due to DOGE plummeting. But when I was knee deep in the crypto world, I came across RARIBLE &amp; OPENSEA. I've created accounts for both of these NFT marketplaces. But, I haven't been active on either one of these sites for quite some time now. I opened up my rarible after months of it being idle to see if I could put together some NFT's. Then, suddenly I looked at my balance, and it was $94. I thought I had some money left over from my previous tinkering, I was trying to see if I could withdraw it. But, I was met with epic failure. Maybe about 2 hrs later, I noticed my balance jumped up to about $1,200!! I'm definitely trying to take it out now!! LOL.. Only thing is, I cant withdraw the money, nor can I buy NFT's to try and sell them, then withdraw that way. Can anyone help me with this dilemma?",-0.2999,0.063,0.88,0.056

Hi all.  Quick question about nfts.  I understand that it is a public database where some people have exclusive ownership of some image or video or whatever.  I also understand that this or a similar technology will be used in the future by some virtual world or other and those nfts in that world from that provider will have some value.  A $5 hat in Fortnite has value because I can use it in Fortnite. It just seems to me that all these people are buying and selling Fortnite hats but there is no Fortnite yet and when it does exist it will not accept hats that have already been sold by / to third party vendors.  I.e people are buying and selling stuff that will not be used by whoever or whatever becomes the dominant digital platform for let's say digital art.

"One of the many sectors that grew exponentially within the crypto industry in the past year was non-fungible tokens ([NFT development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/non-fungible-token-development)). Its sales volume growth from about $94 million in 2020 to $24.9 billion in 2021 is a clear indication of the same. However, emerging financial markets are always at risk of falling victim to criminal elements, and NFTs have been no exception.  Just last month, the story of an art collector who lost $2.2 million worth of NFT in a wallet hack made headlines around the world. Mainly, he highlighted the risks that exist in this nascent asset class. A phishing scam had emptied his Ethereum wallet of 15 NFTs valued at a total of $2.2 million, including four apes from the “Bored Ape Yacht Club” collection. He though he was able to retrieve some pieces of his digital art collection with the help of NFT's OpenSea marketplace. However, not everyone is lucky.  NFT creator “Richerd” emphasized the same thing on Twitter recently, claiming that once an NFT leaves his possession, there is nothing he can do to get it back. However, this “unforgiveness” of blockchain technology can be circumvented by following a few steps according to him, the most important of which is educating oneself.  Apart from this, however, the founder of the NFT minting platform, Manifold, suggested that it was imperative to protect the privacy of one's 'seed phrase'. The seed phrase is a generated list of typically 12 to 24 words, in a specific order, issued to cryptocurrency wallet users to regain access and control of their on-chain funds. In this regard they said,  *“I can't stress this enough, there should never be a fingerprint of your seed phrase, if someone gets these words then all is lost, they will always be in full control of your wallet. No site should ask you for your seed phrase.”*  Furthermore, one should also prefer to use a hardware wallet to store their NFTs, as assets stored in software wallets could be exposed to malware, key loggers, screen capture devices, and key-seeking file inspectors.  Users should also be aware of the URLs they click on, as many of them could be scammers looking for an opportunity, according to Richerd.  Lastly, he also stressed that NFT holders should verify the originating website and pay close attention to where they are signing, as rushed transactions could be malicious.  While NFT enthusiasts can certainly take these steps to protect the NFTs they own, the saga of property theft here hardly ends here.  Lately, various artists around the world have started complaining about their stolen artwork, music, and other original content created on NFT without their permission. An abundance of piracy in the sector could mean that claims that technology revolutionizes arts patronage finally lose weight.",-0.1045,0.082,0.841,0.077

Along with it, all initiatives related to AVAX and Metaverse began to rise. With the industry proliferating, nobody has time to think.  Could NFT be an illusion? If you've been following the news, you probably know that the biggest investor, perhaps even creator, of the Metaverse craze is Facebook (Meta). Before Zuckerberg took any radical steps on Metaverse and NFT, the whole NFT industry was an illusion. Because nothing that we cannot exhibit or receive a reward for can create such a large industry. It's precisely why Metaverse Impasse! I say. Because if radical steps are not taken about Metaverse shortly, NFT will be disappointing.

"Over the last year, WAX has been making a lot of noise in the NFT world, and they've been exceptionally loud about their trademarked vIRL™️ NFTs. If you've not heard of them, its really just a branded tagline to describe an NFT that is able to grant you a physical item. The actual process of how it goes from WAX to Real Life however, appears to be shrouded in mystery, with little to no information available to either collectors nor creators. In fact, since large names like Funko, and Hasbro have joined WAX, the vIRL name seems restricted to only those select few deemed worthy enough in their eyes. Completely abandoning the communities and block producers that have had to fend for themselves in developing on and building up the EOS based sidechain with anothing more than a skeleton of developer docs that weren't even up-to-date when released. Despite this, fantastic communities have arose from WAX to build some really incredible dApps, and earned the chain the title ""King of NFTs.""  We believe that WAX is and always has been about the communities it creates, not about the companies who have bought their way in , while contributing nothing of value to the chain as a whole. WAX continues to stray further and further away from decentralization, and we think that making sure every creator and collector has the accessibility and visibility to the same resources and tools is the first step in returning WAX to it's communities.  This first starts with our Physical Redemptions, that will bring what vIRL™️ couldn't, for real collectors, and with actual creators. A truly accessible, and transparent system for redeemable NFTs, aswell as representing and trading your physical items on the Blockchain.  All the details will be released in our official whitepaper at the start of the year, but for now you can read about the first project to use the system, and other announcements from NFTNT at www.nfnt.medium.com",-0.0716,0.033,0.934,0.032

"So, to start off I don't have any interest in purchasing or 'getting into' NFt's I'm not gonna be swung or grifted into a full turnaround, I just want to understand your guy's ideological standpoint and how your hobby thinks it will grow. Because, to an outsider, it just seems like a group of people who have allowed capitalism and a hunt for a community to manipulate art in the most bizarre way.  The whole community seems to be built around the idea of reselling art, but I have no interest in that, I don't care if a bit of art keeps its value, I don't care if it gives me access to a community. I buy art because it makes me feel something, I think injecting capitalism into the very core purpose of the artistic endeavor is basically the opposite of everything 'art' truly is.   I'm sure some of you might say, that there are a multitude of benefits beyond just art, but I don't have any interest in storing any more of my data digitally, I would, every single time if given the choice, rather own a physical copy of something, I put up with Steam, but I think a large percentage of people in the 'real world' think like this. I’m not interested in keeping my shit in the ‘Blockchain’ I want to keep it in a drawer.   Also, just finally and what really fascinates me, is this image problem, surely it's an existential crisis for your hobby. Again, from an outsider's perspective, it seems as though it is a Dutch tulip situation. Where if the market, which I'm sorry is a really small group of people, begins to contract, then you'll all be left holding very expensive JPG's.   It just seems to me, that all this talk of deconstructing the major institutional levers of centralisation is ethereal talk, flotsam, and jetsom in the wind, so disconnected from the needs of the average individual or enjoyer of art.   I'm all for the decentralization of capital, I'm a Marxist but I do not believe that argument can stand alongside Mcdonalds and the world's largest corporations, falling over themselves to squeeze yet more money from average people via your hobby.  I don't want to talk about a utopian envisioned future of 'personal independence' as that's framed by this community. I want to know how all of this materially improves the lives of working people in any way because it would seem to me, to helpfully provide yet another level of 'bread and circuses' to further remove and distract people from the abject conditions of their daily struggle.   So yeah, I'd just be interested to hear what a group of ‘converts’ say when presented with that sort of ideological question, and personal objection to your 'digital philosophy' rather than the easily answerable, however terrible and vast, ecological question.",-0.062,0.102,0.795,0.103

Considering Ethers’ gas prices are so high and I don’t want that to deter people I’ve looked at Tezos, flow, binance and polygon, however polygon confuses me a little because I know it’s on the Ethereum chain but it’s it’s own coin with lower gas prices right?

"There's so many P2E games out there now. But most of these games are not very fun at all. Of course they might start out fun and the prospect of earning from them may keep you playing. But after a while, the grind becomes unrealistic, the gameplay gets old, and it simply stops being fun. In other words, it stops being ""play"" to earn and starts becoming ""work"" to earn.   This is what MixMob is trying to avoid. By keeping their gameplay engaging enough, they hope players will stick with them. But that's not all. Their upper hand is the team that they have. In fact, they have developers from AAA games like Halo, FIFA, and Battlefield. On top of that, their art is just jaw-dropping awesomeness.

# 什么是元宇宙游戏   元宇宙游戏的项目有着区块链的基因。因此与普通的项目不同的。就拿现在的游戏来说，现在的游戏是商家设计好的情节，你在里面是打怪升级做任务，氪金消费买装备。游戏中的角色和道具并不是属于你个人的，而是属于游戏厂商的。   而元宇宙的游戏项目不同，基于区块链技术和游戏内角色、道具等元素“NFT”化，你在游戏的投资也会成为属于你个人的“数字资产”，你可以通过交易道具或者赚取奖励代币来获得收益。   元宇宙游戏本身也具有去中心化特征，就拿“sandbox”来说，厂商做好了底层的框架和体验版的游戏，而里面的游戏场景是用户来创造的。你设计的巧妙好玩，就有人参与，你就可以挣钱了。简单的理解，就像现在的今日头条或者抖音，他们并不生产内容或者视频。这些内容和视频是由参与者（用户）创造的，做的内容流量越大，挣钱就越多，也被称为UGC的模式。   ## 如何在元宇宙游戏中挣钱   我们结合一下目前现在最火的sandbox 和AXIE这两个元宇宙游戏来讲一下如何挣钱：   ### sandbox   首先是sandbox，这是一个体验和打造类的3D版像素游戏。游戏中一共有166464块数字土地，是沙盒平台类的“数字地产”   用户可以用“sand”来购买土地。土地也可以在NFT平台上进行二次销售。所以像这种蓝精灵、特斯拉等各种大厂都在里面买了大块土地。   每次平台发行土地的时候，基本都是被秒光的。如果没有抢到土地，可以在open sea 的二级市场上购买已经登记出售的土地。购买后，你可以用游戏提供的编辑器，在你的土地上自由的设计运行自己的游戏。这个游戏编辑器非常容易的上手，它不需要任何的代码知识，只需要拖拽就可以完成一个元素的操作。   · 拥有的土地可以通过购买其他装备或者资产来进行填充，另外可以把它租给其他的游戏开发者来获得租金等等；   · 如果你是一个纯新手，就玩sandbox官方预设的游戏，完成任务就可以得到sand奖励，以此来购买道具和资源；   · 对于创作者来讲，除了在自己的土地上打造个性化的游戏世界之外，玩家制作的像素模型、游戏道具还可以上架售卖来获得收益。   因此获得三个收益。搞好了这个收益还是很不菲的。   ### Axie Infinity   这款游戏被国内玩家亲切地称为“阿蟹”，热度非常之高。Axie是跑在以太坊上的游戏，简单的来说就是买个阿蟹和别人干架的游戏。   首先买阿蟹需要在市场上买，这些阿蟹都是被NFT化了，每个阿蟹都是唯一的，而且它的资质和属性各不相同，属性还是相生相克的，就类似金克木，木克土的机制一样，和梦幻西游中的宝宝是差不多的。   每场战斗需要上场三个阿蟹，这就意味着你想玩这个游戏，需要先拥有3个阿蟹。   游戏战斗赢了就有机会获得药水道具。爱情药水是孵化阿蟹蛋的必要道具。阿蟹蛋又是一公一母两个阿蟹配对生产的。当然了，父母的资质好，生出来的阿蟹蛋就越优秀。   阿蟹蛋和爱情药水在市场上都可以交易。所以这个游戏主要获得收益的途径就是通过战斗胜利来获得更多的游戏道具，和孵化出更高级的阿蟹，然后通过市场交易来进行获利。   这段时间Axie发展的是异常迅猛，它的NFT的交易量都超过了10亿美金，已经远远的超过第二名NBA top shot。   ## 所以元宇宙游戏新商机还是骗局   我认为任何游戏都有一定的风险，投入和产出会有一定周期。新玩家一定要先搞清楚游戏怎么玩、游戏的开发背景和依托的区块链技术，全面了解之后再开始投入，因为你只能挣到认知以内的钱。总之在这两个你玩的好的确是商机，切记不要被国内某些公司制作没有水准的小游戏给忽悠了。  想要投资顶级的NFT？可以详细了解下JTeam战队NFT项目：  JTeam是由周杰伦在台北创立的电竞战队，旗下拥有《英雄联盟》分部、《英雄联盟手游》分部、《和平精英》分部、《永劫无间》分部等职业战队，在电竞领域取得了不可小觑的成就。首次发售1000个NFT以及赠送粉丝勋章详情请见: Jfans.space,0.2023,0.0,0.951,0.049

I have two main collections I mint every single day:  1) daily sounds, yes as the name implies a new sound every single day. (have been minting for the past   83 days) I messed up day 73, because apparently if 100% of your collection is on polygon and you accidently mint on eth, ON the same collection! you don't get a warning,  but yeah I still take the blame on this one.  2) notes for millennia, a note a day that I've been minting for the past 110 days  I'm not making this up, [https://opensea.io/collection/notesformillennia](https://opensea.io/collection/notesformillennia)   So when opensea released their 50 item limit per collection I was unable to add items to both collections effectively destroying both collections.   As you can see here it says 13 hours ago instead of 1 day ago, I was asleep when opensea reversed their decision on the 50 item limit. meaning day 110 was minted after 00:00 GMT (all other NFTs were minted on a daily basis) the only silver lining is, day 110 was minted before midnight in NYC so I could follow that as my day definition, I'd still need to check if all the nfts were minted before NYC midnight which I'm not 100% sure of but it's likely as I usually mint when I get home from work.    https://preview.redd.it/jwks1ozrkge81.png?width=1894&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c758db6a9a03cdf82c602899a905e2be4c6fbd4c  Notes: Yes, I understand I should mint from contracts, I plan on doing so with the second volume which might be after day 365  I don't know if I want to keep minting anymore, I mean I probably will, but this has caused a severe mental blow to my momentum",0.2344,0.063,0.864,0.073

So I am a digital artist and go by the name Dexaler. I have an insta page with a low following(224) and one of my followers just messaged me a couple days ago that someone has been stealing my artwork and has minted NFTs out of them and sold them as his own work. FYI, I have not sold a single one of my works as NFTs yet. He has been reported to the marketplace help Center and has been removed from the site with the NFTs burned. However he managed to make around $1700 before he was caught. The fact that people can get away with such acts and that there is no way to prevent them from committing such crimes frustrates me to my very core. I am glad that that person has been removed but I am not how to proceed from here. What steps would you guys recommend I take?",0.2728,0.051,0.88,0.068

"    When the internet first came out, it too was called a bubble, by many people who refused to invest in it. The majority in reality thought it would fail, and look at where we are now. The internet is literally everywhere. And those who invested early are the biggest and richest men and women alive.  NFTs are considered a bubble my many, and that’s okay. Let them stay out of our way while we invest and make big bucks. Especially gaming NFTs have hit the jackpot big time, any person invested in Axie Infinity or Kitty Inu will tell you how lucrative the market really is.

In other words: no way to turn it into a ""gun registry"" * Optional proof of background check: a digitally signed certificate saying that the buyer passed a background check.  Note: NICS doesn't get details about the gun(s) in question, or even if a transaction takes place.   * Proof of sale: be able to prove that you sold the gun, and when.

"I’m thinking of creating an NFT collection. I have a background in digital art, I have an idea for a collection and I figured it’s worth trying. I want to create a smaller collection (probably 100) of NFT’s that each, over time, generate their own unique tokens to the person holding them. The idea being that if you own one of the NFT’s every 60 or 90 days it would give you a token that only can be received by that own that NFT. However, to be blunt, I have no experience in writing code whatsoever. My question is; Is it possible to make an NFT with this function and if it is, how difficult would it be for someone with no experience in coding? Also, what do you think of the idea? I’d be curious to hear what people think of it.",0.3094,0.048,0.881,0.071

"Hi,  I am trying to understand something. Maybe I am wrong.  I have been looking at ""Everydays: The First 5000 Days""  Beeple strated on May 1, 2007. Thus day 5000 is January 6, 2021.  The Everyday from January 6, 2021 is Trump sitting on the Capitol - this is Everyday 5000.  The Everyday from January 7, 2021 is the one with the different characters - this is 5001 and still on the bottom right corner of ""Everydays: The First 5000 Days"".  Quote: ‘I made this on the 5,000th day. It incorporates a lot of the characters and themes I’ve touched on over the past few years, depicted as muses around a child drawing — as a reference back to my first everyday drawing.’  But that is day 5001.  So it looks like he missed one day or there are 5001 Everydays on ""Everydays: The First 5000 Days"".

Grab your favorite crypto sniper bot (usually cost like $200 for a lifetime license), join the telegram group of any upcoming NFT project and when they post the IDO contract address just use the bot to snipe the token and instantly resell it at a profit.

I was an active user in the community, I even got the chance to talk to Chris and ask him some existential questions in voice chat a few hours ago.   Chris Dyer logs off, and the sickness spreads. All of the others working on the project that were silent for so long begin drinking in excess and flaunting their newfound clout. The opposite of what Chris' mission has always been.   I was incredibly upset to see this happen. I minted 4 NFTs just hours ago because I knew that I could trust Chris Dyer and is team. Or so I thought. One of the biggest perks of owning these NFTs is exclusive access to community oriented events with the Galakticgang, which the project is named.   And the drunken fools just outright banned me for questioning their antics. Is there anything that can be done? I accept if you point and laugh because haha I purchased an NFT, but Chris' work has been dear to me since crypto was in its infancy. And I unearthed my old portfolio for the sole reason of supporting him and his art. And then bam, into the abyss I go.  I am looking for advice on how to go forward in this project.

"Hi,  I'm studying the cryptoverse to understand how to realize a dapp/NFT project. I mostly have the tech side of things (solidity, gas, the blockchain itself etc) down; what I am missing is an understanding of how to calculate and plan the project. Is there good guides that address things like where does what money go, how you should set up the timeline, what expenses one might not think of, smart contract license and IP, etc? Also, what are no-nos that scare people off a project that I might be unwittingly committing?  Thanks for any input!",0.3806,0.075,0.824,0.101
"Hi there. I have recently acquired some old paintings from a few dead family members, and so I've decided to turn them into NFTs. I've gone through the whole process of scanning them, digitizing them, and doing some color correcting in photoshop and now I'm ready to turn them into NFTs and sell them. The problem is that I don't really know how to promote them. I only have about \~$300, which is not enough to pay a prominent Instagram account. Any ideas? Thanks in advance.",0.381,0.076,0.799,0.125
